There are two ways to leave Las Vegas: broke or in a box. My great-grandfather Meyer managed to avoid both for ninety years, and now that legacy is my problem.

I stand on the mezzanine of *The Desert Siren*, watching the floor. It’s a Friday night, which means the air is thick with desperation, cheap cologne, and the specific, metallic tang of ozone that radiates off the old air scrubbers. From up here, the casino looks like a living organ, pulsing with a low-grade fever. 

Down in the pit, the sounds are analog. Real. That’s the point. You go to the Strip if you want a computer to tell you you’ve lost your mortgage payment with a cheery digital chirp. You come to Fremont Street, to *my* street, if you want to hear the physical slap of cards on felt and the heavy, clay-composite clatter of chips stacking up. 

I lean against the brass railing, the metal cool against my forearms. My dress is vintage Halston, a liquid slide of emerald silk that costs more than the Honda Civic pulling into the valet out front. It’s armor. Everything here is armor. The dim lighting, the velvet drapes heavy enough to smother a man, the crystal chandeliers that haven’t been changed since Sinatra was skinny—it’s all designed to make you feel like you’ve stepped into a noir film where you might actually win.

But the house always wins. I am the house. And lately, winning feels a lot like drowning.

"Miss Goldstein?"

I don't turn. I keep my eyes on Table Four. Blackjack. "What is it, Marco?"

Marco is my floor manager, a man shaped like a fire hydrant and just as immovable. He smells of peppermint and anxiety.

"We got a situation at the high-limit tables. Guy in a polo shirt. He’s had too much comped gin and he’s getting handsy with Delilah."

My spine straightens, a reflex honed by three generations of mob paranoia. "Handsy how?"

"Touching the cards. Touching her arm when she deals. He’s loud, Rae. He’s scaring the regulars."

I push off the railing. "The regulars are fossilized; a stiff breeze would scare them. But nobody touches the dealers."

I start walking. The carpet under my heels is a deep, bruised burgundy, patterned in swirling gold acanthus leaves designed to keep your eyes up, on the games. I move through the crowd like a shark cutting through a school of particularly slow tuna. I catch the eye of the pit boss, give a microscopic nod. He knows the drill.

The offender is easy to spot. He’s wearing a pastel pink polo that screams *golf weekend* and a watch the size of a dinner plate. He’s drunk, sweating through the cotton, leaning over the green felt like he owns the place.

"Come on, sweetheart," he slurs, his hand hovering over the shoe. "Hit me. I can feel it."

Delilah, a pro who’s been dealing since I was in diapers, looks bored, but her jaw is tight. She hates being called sweetheart.

I slide up next to him. I don't touch him. I just exist in his space, a sudden drop in temperature.

"Sir," I say. My voice is low, the register of a cello. It cuts through the ambient noise of the slot levers cranking in the distance. "The lady is working. And the cards are for looking, not touching."

He turns, blinking blearily. His eyes rake over me, lingering on the neckline of the Halston. He grins, a wet, sloppy expression. "And who are you? The entertainment?"

"I’m the reason you’re still sitting in that chair and not bouncing off the pavement in the alley," I say, smiling. It’s my customer service smile. It doesn't reach my eyes. It doesn't even reach my nose. "I’m the owner."

He laughs, a bark of sound that sprays a little spit. "You? You’re a kid. Where’s the guy who runs this joint? The old guy?"

"Dead," I say flatly. "And I’m not a kid. I’m the person deciding whether to cash you out or ban you for life. Right now, the odds aren't in your favor."

He bristles, that fragile male ego inflating like a pufferfish. He stands up, swaying. He’s big, taller than me in my four-inch heels. He steps into my personal space, bringing the smell of gin and aggressive entitlement with him.

"Listen here, bitch," he starts, pointing a finger at my face.

Everything slows down. This is the moment. The pivot point. I can see the security guards stepping forward from the shadows, hands reaching for radios. I hold up a hand to stop them.

I don't flinch. I don't blink. I look at his finger, then up at his eyes.

"You have a tell," I say softly.

He freezes. "What?"

"You bluff when you're scared. You get loud. You puff up." I tilt my head, examining him like a biology slide. "You’re down four grand. Your wife thinks you’re at a conference in Henderson. And you’re terrified that if you walk away now, you’re just a loser in a pink shirt."

His face goes slack. The color drains out of it, leaving him sallow under the chandeliers.

"How did you—"

"I know everything that happens in this room," I lie. I don't know about the wife, but guys like this always have a wife they’re lying to. It’s a safe bet. "Now. You’re going to apologize to Delilah. Then you’re going to take your chips to the cage, cash out, and take a cab back to the strip where you belong. If you ever touch one of my staff again, I won't call the police. I’ll call your wife."

He swallows. The fight goes out of him like air from a punctured tire. He mutters something that might be an apology to Delilah’s left shoulder, grabs his chips, and stumbles toward the cage.

I watch him go. The adrenaline spikes in my blood, hot and sharp—a familiar drug. This is the only time I feel real. When I’m defending the fortress. When I’m holding the line against the encroaching tide of mediocrity.

"Nice read, boss," Delilah says, shuffling the deck with a sound like a zipper closing.

"He was an easy mark," I say, smoothing the silk of my dress. "Keep the table open. The night is young."

I turn and walk away before she can see my hands trembling. Not from fear. From exhaustion. From the crushing weight of keeping a ghost alive. Every night it’s the same war, fighting off the drunks, the cheats, and the relentless march of time.

I look up at the ceiling, at the ornate plaster molding that’s starting to crack near the vent. 

*I’m trying, Grandpa,* I think, the thought bitter on my tongue. *But God, you didn't leave me a kingdom. You left me a bunker.*

#### * * *

My office is a mausoleum dedicated to the mid-century. The walls are paneled in mahogany so dark it sucks the light out of the room. The desk is a slab of oak big enough to land a Cessna on. Behind it, a wall of monitors flickers with black-and-white feeds from the security cameras—the only modern concession in the room.

Arthur is sitting in one of the leather guest chairs, looking like a crumpled receipt. He’s been the family lawyer since the seventies, and he wears his weariness like a tailored suit.

He doesn't say hello when I walk in. He just slides a thick, blue folder across the desk. It lands with a heavy, final *thud* that echoes in the silence.

"He upped the bid," Arthur says. His voice is gravel and cigarettes. "Twenty percent over market value, Rae. Plus a retention package for the staff."

I walk behind the desk and sink into the high-backed leather chair. It was Meyer’s chair. I still feel like a child playing dress-up in it. I don't open the folder. I know what’s inside. Legalese for *surrender*.

"Julian Vane doesn't want the staff," I say, kicking off my heels. I rub the arch of my foot, staring at the folder like it’s a coiled viper. "He wants the gaming license and the real estate. He’ll keep the dealers for six months, then replace them with touch screens and automated shufflers. He’ll gut the building, wrap the whole thing in glass and LED screens, and call it *The Vane Retro* or something equally soulless."

"He’s offering forty million dollars, Rae." Arthur leans forward, his knuckles white on the armrests. "The plumbing needs a complete overhaul. The HVAC is on life support. The pension fund for the union is... heavy. You’re bleeding cash."

"I’m not bleeding. I’m investing."

"You’re hemorrhaging," Arthur corrects gently. "The Quarterlies are down. The demographic is aging out. The kids—the ones with the disposable income—they don't want rat pack authenticity. They want day clubs and bottle service and DJs who press play on a laptop."

I pick up a silver lighter from the desk—heavy, engraved with a Star of David—and flip it open and shut. *Clink. Clink. Clink.* It’s a nervous tic I picked up from watching old movies.

"I’m not selling to Vane," I say. "He’s a vulture. He doesn't build anything; he just consumes."

"He’s a vulture with a very large checkbook," Arthur counters. "And he’s not used to hearing the word 'no'. He’s taking this personally, Rae. The hostile takeover bid isn't just business anymore. He sees you as a... variable he can't solve."

"Good. Let him choke on the math."

I stand up and walk to the window. It’s bulletproof glass, looking out over the neon canyon of Fremont Street. Below, the canopy of lights flashes in a seizure-inducing rhythm. I can see the tourists shuffling like cattle, their faces illuminated by the glow of giant slushie cups.

"It’s not just about the money, Arthur," I say, my voice quiet. "If I sell, everything Meyer built is gone. The history. The stories. It all gets paved over for a parking garage."

"Meyer is dead," Arthur says. He says it softly, but it hits me like a slap. "He doesn't care about the building, Rae. He cared about *you*. He wouldn't want you drowning in debt to protect a shrine."

I turn back to him. "I’m not drowning. I’m treading water. There’s a difference."

Arthur sighs, a long, rattling sound. He stands up, joints popping. "I have to present the offer. It’s my fiduciary duty. But I told Vane’s counsel you’d reject it."

"You know me so well."

"I know *Stubborn*," he corrects. He moves to the door, then pauses, hand on the brass knob. "Be careful, Rae. Vane isn't like the old crew. He doesn't respect the unwritten rules. If he can't buy you out, he’ll try to burn you out."

"Let him try," I say, chin lifting. "I have sprinklers."

Arthur gives me a sad smile and leaves. The door clicks shut, sealing me in.

Alone, the bravado drains out of me. I slump back into the chair, the leather creaking. I pull the blue folder toward me and flip it open. The numbers swim before my eyes. Zeros. So many zeros. Enough money to walk away. To move to Paris. To never smell stale smoke or hear the desperate prayers of gamblers again.

I trace the edge of the paper. It’s tempting. God, it’s tempting. It’s a lifeboat in a storm.

But taking it means admitting I failed. It means admitting that a Goldstein woman couldn't hold the fort. It means I’m just a curator of a museum that nobody visits anymore.

I close the folder and shove it into the drawer, burying it under a stack of invoices. Out of sight, out of mind.

I reach for the bottle of whiskey on the sidebar, pouring a finger into a crystal glass. The amber liquid catches the light. I need to numb the buzz of anxiety that’s started to hum under my skin, a vibration that feels like a warning.

My computer pings.

It’s a sharp, jarring sound in the quiet room. Not the soft chime of a personal email. The harsh, urgent alert of the secure server.

I frown, swirling the whiskey. It’s nearly midnight. Nothing good comes in at midnight.

I lean forward, waking the screen. The glow illuminates my face, harsh and blue.

**SENDER: NEVADA GAMING CONTROL BOARD**
**SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INDEPENDENT AUDIT**

My stomach drops. The whiskey glass halts halfway to my mouth.

The Gaming Board doesn't email you at midnight. They send guys in windbreakers at noon. Unless...

I open the attachment. The language is dense, bureaucratic, and terrifyingly specific.

*...pursuant to Section 463.145... suspicion of irregularities in high-roller accounts... independent forensic accounting firm retained...*

I scan down, my heart hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird. This isn't a random check. This is a weaponized audit. They’re looking for money laundering. They’re looking for the kind of dirt that puts padlocks on the doors and owners in federal prison.

And then I see the name.

*Assigned Auditor: Ezra Katz. Firm: Sterling & Associates.*

I freeze. The name triggers a memory, sharp and jagged. Katz. Not a common name in this town anymore. Not since the clean-up in the eighties.

I type the name into the search bar. *Ezra Katz.*

The results are sparse. No social media. No LinkedIn profile filled with self-aggrandizing posts. Just a few mentions in financial journals. *The Architect of the forensic audit.* *The man who brought down the chaotic collapse of the Omni Hedge Fund.*

There’s one photo. It’s grainy, taken at a distance, like he’s the one under surveillance.

He’s dark. Dark hair, cut severely short. A jawline that looks like it was carved out of granite. He’s wearing a suit that fits too well, standing outside a courthouse, looking at the camera with eyes that seem to strip the lens of its mechanics. He looks cold. precise.

He looks like a predator who eats numbers for breakfast.

"Vane," I whisper. The realization hits me with the force of a physical blow. Julian Vane couldn't buy me, so he pulled strings with the commission. He sent a hitman. A hitman with a calculator.

If this Katz character finds one misplaced decimal, one "creative" accounting trick from the old days—and God knows this building is built on a foundation of creative accounting—I’m finished. They’ll revoke the license. Vane will swoop in and buy the carcass for pennies on the dollar.

Fear, cold and slippery, tries to coil around my throat. I force it down. I swallow the whiskey in one burn.

"Okay," I say to the empty room. "Okay."

I stand up. The exhaustion is gone, replaced by a frantic, crystalline clarity. This is war.

I hit the intercom button on my desk.

"Marco?"

"Yeah, boss?" He sounds tired.

"Lock the file room," I say. My voice is steady, iron-hard. "The physical files. The basement archives. Everything from before 2000. Put it in the vault."

"Rae? What’s going on?"

"We’re getting audited," I say. "The heavy kind. A guy named Ezra Katz is coming tomorrow morning."

"Katz? Like... *the* Katz family?"

"I don't know," I say, staring at the grainy photo on my screen. "But he’s coming to tear us apart."

"What do we do?"

I look at the man in the photo. He looks rigid. Inflexible. A man of rules and absolute values.

Men like that are dangerous. But they also have a weakness. They think the world makes sense. They think that if they add up the columns, the answer will always be the truth.

I’ve lived in a casino my whole life. I know that the truth is just another card in the deck, depending on how you shuffle it.

"We welcome him," I say, a dark smile touching my lips. "We open the doors. We give him coffee. And we bury him in so much paperwork he won't be able to find his own ass with a map."

"Rae..."

"Do it, Marco. And tell security I want eyes on him from the second he steps onto the property. I want to know when he sneezes. I want to know what he orders for lunch."

I cut the connection.

The silence of the office rushes back in, but it feels different now. Charged. The air conditioning kicks on with a low rumble, chilling the sweat on the back of my neck.

I walk to the window again, looking down at the chaos of the street. Somewhere out there, Ezra Katz is sleeping. Or maybe he doesn't sleep. Maybe he just plugs himself into a wall socket and recharges his sense of moral superiority.

He thinks he’s coming to inspect a business. He thinks he’s coming to solve a puzzle.

He has no idea he’s walking into a rigged game.

I press my hand against the cold glass. My reflection ghosts over the neon lights—pale, sharp-eyed, terrified, and furious.

"Welcome to the Siren, Mr. Katz," I whisper. "Try not to lose your shirt."

I turn off the lights. The darkness swallows the room, but the red light of the security camera blinks in the corner. Watching. Always watching.

I grab my purse. I need to go home. I need to shower off the smell of smoke and fear. Tomorrow, the house has to be perfect. Tomorrow, I have to perform the greatest magic trick of my life: pretending we have nothing to hide.

I walk out, the click of my heels sounding like gunshots in the empty hallway.

The game is on. And I never fold.
