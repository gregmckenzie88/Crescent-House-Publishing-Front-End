The snare drum is a lie.

I stare at the waveform on the monitor, a jagged blue mountain range that represents a drummer named Kyle who thinks tempo is a suggestion rather than a law of physics. I zoom in until the beats look like scars against the grid. He’s dragging. Always dragging. Like he’s playing underwater while the rest of the band is sprinting on dry land.

With a sigh that rattles my own ribs, I highlight the offending transient. *Snip.* I drag it to the grid line. *Snap.*

I do this forty-three times.

This is what I do. I take mediocrity and I sanitize it. I take the messy, drunken, ego-fueled noise of East Austin’s "next big things" and I perform surgery until they sound like professionals. I am the janitor of dreams.

"Let's hear it," I mumble to the empty room.

I hit the spacebar. The track plays back through the Genelec monitors. The drums are now mathematically perfect. They are tight. They are precise.

They are completely dead.

I lean back in my Herman Miller chair—the only expensive thing left in this room that I haven't considered selling—and rub the heels of my hands into my eyes until I see sparks. The studio, affectionately dubbed "The Bunker," smells the way it always does: stale coffee, oxidizing copper, and the distinct, static-charged scent of dust burning off vacuum tubes. It’s a smell that used to make my heart race with possibility. Now, it just smells like rent due.

I reach for the lukewarm mug of espresso on the console, my fingers brushing the faders. My sanctuary. My womb. My coffin.

I built the walls of The Bunker three feet thick. Rockwool, mass-loaded vinyl, floating floors. I told myself it was for the acoustics, to keep the outside world from bleeding onto the tracks. But the truth is simpler, uglier. I built it so no one could hear me. And more importantly, so I didn't have to hear them.

My phone buzzes against the console, a vibrating insect skittering toward the talkback button. The screen lights up with a name that makes my stomach clench: *Marcus Vane.*

I let it buzz. Once. Twice. The vibration hums against the metal chassis of the mixing board, a low E-flat.

I shouldn't answer. Marcus is a manager who treats artists like racehorses—invests heavy, runs them until their legs break, then shoots them behind the barn. But the red light on my power conditioner is flickering, warning me that the main transformer is about to shit the bed, and my bank account is currently echoing with the sound of hollow spaces.

I swipe right. "I'm not interested, Marcus."

"Carmen. My favorite recluse." His voice is slick, compressed, like he’s speaking through a limiter with the ratio cranked too high. "You haven't even heard the pitch."

"I don't need to. If it’s another mumble-rap collective from West Campus, I’d rather drink bleach."

"It’s not a kid. It’s a resurrection project."

I pick up a pen and start tapping a rhythm against the armrest. *One, two, three-and-four.* "I don't do rehab, Marcus. You know that. Send them to Nashville. They love a sob story."

"Declan Wolfe."

The pen stops.

The silence that follows isn't empty. It’s heavy. It has weight and texture, like a wool blanket thrown over a fire.

"Declan Wolfe is retired," I say, my voice steady, though my pulse does a traitorous little skip. "Declan Wolfe had a psychotic break on stage in 2014 and hasn't been seen since. Rumor has it he’s living in a cave eating berries."

"He’s in Austin. He has a notebook full of songs. And he won’t let anyone record him." Marcus pauses, and I can hear the click of his lighter. "Except you."

"Me?" I laugh, a dry, scratching sound. "I’ve never met the man. Why would he want me?"

"Because he knows about Silas. He knows you were the one who actually produced *Midnight Altar*, not your ex-husband. He says he wants the person who made the ghost sounds."

My blood turns cold. *Midnight Altar.* The album that won a Grammy. The album Silas accepted the award for while I sat on the couch in sweatpants, nursing a glass of whiskey and a signed NDA.

"He’s crazy, Marcus. Clinically."

"He’s a genius. And the label is offering a fifty-thousand-dollar advance for the producer. Plus points on the backend."

Fifty thousand.

I look around the studio. I look at the frayed fabric on the acoustic panels. I look at the flickering transformer light. I look at the emptiness where my own guitar used to sit before I sold it to pay for the soundproofing.

"He’s going to be a nightmare," I say, and it’s not a refusal. It’s a resignation.

"He’s bringing the demo over in an hour. Don’t bite his head off, Carmen. He’s... fragile."

"I eat fragile for breakfast."

I hang up before he can say anything else. My hand is trembling slightly. I shove it under my thigh to stop it.

Declan Wolfe.

*Goddamn it.*

#### * * *

I spend the hour doing exactly what I shouldn't do: I go looking for the wreckage.

My internet connection is throttled, so the video loads in jerky staccato bursts. It’s grainy footage from a festival in Chicago, ten years ago. The crowd is a shifting ocean of pixels.

There he is.

Declan Wolfe at twenty-four. He looks like something carved out of driftwood and hunger. He’s clutching a Guild acoustic guitar like it’s the only thing keeping him from falling off the face of the earth. He’s beautiful in that way that makes you want to look away—too raw, too open.

He’s singing "Iron & Wine," but halfway through the second verse, he stops.

He doesn't just stop playing. He stops *being*.

I lean closer to the screen. The audio is terrible—distorted wind and the roar of fifty thousand people—but I can see his face. His eyes go wide, the pupils blowing out until the iris is gone. He looks terrified. Not stage-fright terrified. *Prey* terrified. Like he can see something coming for him that no one else can.

He drops the guitar. The feedback squeal is like a knife. He brings his hands up to his ears, pressing hard, trying to crush his own skull. And then he just walks off. No wave, no apology. He walks off the stage and out of the world.

I close the browser tab. The silence in the studio rushes back in, vacuum-sealing the room.

I know that look. I’ve seen it in the mirror.

It’s the look of someone who realizes that the thing they love is trying to kill them.

I spin my chair around and pace. The Bunker is small—a control room, a vocal booth, and a tiny kitchenette that smells like old plumbing. I pace the length of the control room. Twelve steps. Turn. Twelve steps.

Why me?

*Because you made the ghost sounds.*

I hate that he knows. I hate that this stranger, this broken folk hero, heard the invisible texture I wove into Silas’s tracks—the reversed reverb, the whispered harmonies buried so deep they were felt rather than heard—and recognized it. It feels like an invasion. It feels like he’s been watching me through the glass.

I check my reflection in the dark monitor of the inactive B-room computer. My hair is a disaster, a dark, curling nest held together by a single chopstick. My eyeliner is smudged. I’m wearing a vintage Black Sabbath t-shirt that’s more hole than cotton and cutoff shorts that reveal the scrape on my knee from bumping into the patch bay yesterday.

I look like I live here. Which I basically do.

I don't fix my hair. I don't reapply the liner. Let him see the mechanic, not the hostess. If he’s "fragile," he needs to know that this isn't a spa. It’s a factory. We make sausages here. We don't hold hands.

The buzzer screams.

It’s a harsh, industrial buzz that I installed specifically to discourage drop-ins. It usually makes people flinch.

I walk to the heavy steel door. I take a breath, holding it in my lungs, expanding my ribcage against the anxiety fluttering there. *Professional detachment,* I tell myself. *He is a frequency. He is a signal flow. He is input.*

I unlock the deadbolt. The sound is a loud, metallic *clack* that echoes.

I pull the door open.

The first thing that hits me is the smell. Rain. Not the polite mist of a sprinkler, but the heavy, ozone-charged scent of a thunderstorm smashing into limestone. Beneath that, cedar and old leather.

Then, the visual.

Declan Wolfe is taller than he looked in the videos. Or maybe he just takes up more space now. He’s filling the doorframe, blotting out the harsh Texas sun. He’s wearing a flannel shirt that has been washed so many times the pattern is a ghost of a plaid, sleeves rolled up to reveal forearms roped with vascularity and dusted with dark hair. His jeans are stiff with dirt at the hems. Boots that look like they’ve walked from the border.

But it’s the face that stops my breath.

The boy from the video is gone. This is a man who has weathered. There are lines around his eyes—deep grooves of exhaustion or squinting into the sun. His hair is long, pulled back in a messy knot, strands escaping to frame a jaw that is clenched so tight a muscle ticks beneath the stubble.

He doesn't speak. He just looks at me.

His eyes are a startling, clear grey. The color of a winter sky before snow. They aren't looking at my face; they’re scanning the room behind me, checking the corners, assessing the exits. A wolf checking for traps.

The silence stretches. It’s not awkward; it’s physical. It pushes against my chest.

"You're late," I say. I’m not checking a watch; I don't even know what time it is. It’s just a test. I want to see if he flinches.

He doesn't. His gaze snaps to mine, and for a second, I feel a jolt go straight down my spine—a hot, sharp zip of electricity that pools low in my belly. It’s immediate and completely unwelcome.

"Door was locked," he says.

His voice.

*Jesus.*

It’s a low rumble, a subwoofer frequency that bypasses my ears and vibrates directly in my sternum. It’s gravel and honey and three packs of cigarettes a day, though he smells clean. It’s a voice that sounds like it’s been dragged over rocks.

"It’s a studio," I say, leaning against the doorframe, crossing my arms to hide the fact that my nipples have hardened against the thin cotton of my shirt. "We keep the noise out. Are you coming in, or are you going to stand there and let the humidity fuck up my microphones?"

He blinks. A slow, deliberate movement. He shifts his weight, and I notice a guitar case in his hand—an old, battered thing covered in stickers that have been peeled off, leaving white scars.

"You're Carmen," he states. Not a question.

"I am."

"You look..." He pauses, his eyes dropping to my boots, then traveling up my bare legs, over the frayed denim, stopping at the chopstick in my hair. It’s not a lecherous look. It’s an appraisal. Like he’s checking the structural integrity of a bridge. "...louder than I expected."

My hackles rise. "I'm a producer, Wolfe. I control the volume. You want inside, step inside. You want to analyze me, buy a ticket."

He almost smiles. It’s a micro-expression, a tiny twitch of the corner of his mouth that vanishes before it fully forms. "Fair enough."

He steps past me.

The air shifts as he moves. He radiates heat. Not just warmth—radiating, furnace-blast heat. He passes within inches of me, and the hairs on my arms stand up, reaching for the static charge of him.

I close the door, locking the world out again.

When I turn around, he’s standing in the middle of the control room, looking at the mixing board like it’s a bomb he has to defuse. He hasn't put his guitar down. He’s gripping the handle so hard his knuckles are white.

"Nice rig," he says softly. "Neve?"

"Custom hybrid. Analog front end, digital heart." I walk past him to the captain's chair, reclaiming my territory. I sit down and spin to face him. "Marcus says you have songs."

"I have noise," he corrects. He turns to look at the vocal booth. The glass is dark. "I don't know if they're songs yet."

"That's my job. To tell the difference." I gesture to the leather couch at the back of the room. "Sit. Unpack. Let’s see if the guitar stays in tune or if the humidity killed it."

He doesn't move toward the couch. He stays standing, looming in the center of the room. He feels too big for this space. The Bunker is designed to be cozy, intimate. With him in it, it feels claustrophobic.

"I don't want polish," he says abruptly. He’s looking at the acoustic panels on the wall, avoiding my eyes again. "I listened to the radio on the drive over. Everything sounds like plastic. Everything sounds... grid-locked."

He glances at the screen behind me, where Kyle’s perfectly quantized drum track is still visible.

"I saw what you did to *Midnight Altar*," he continues, his voice dropping an octave, becoming intimate. "The space you left in the mix. The breath before the chorus on 'Shatter.' That wasn't Silas. Silas hates dead air. That was you."

I stiffen. Hearing his name—hearing the credit given to me out loud—is a strange, twisting pain. Like pressing on a bruise.

"Silas wanted that breath cut," I say, the words tumbling out before I can stop them. "He said it sounded unprofessional. I fought him for three days over two seconds of silence."

Declan finally looks at me. Really looks at me. The intensity of his gaze is heavy, visceral. I feel stripped.

"Why?" he asks.

"Because the breath is where the truth is," I say. "The note is just the execution. The breath is the intent."

He stares at me for a long beat. The air between us crackles. I can smell the cedar on him, sharper now. I can see the pulse beating in the hollow of his throat.

Slowly, he sets the guitar case down on the rug. He kneels to undo the latches. His hands are large, the fingers long and scarred, the nails cut to the quick. I watch the tendons in his forearms shift as he snaps the latches open.

*Click. Click. Click.*

The sound is obscenely loud in the quiet room.

He opens the case. Inside lies a Martin D-28 that looks like it’s been dragged behind a truck. The finish is worn down to the raw wood around the soundhole.

He lifts it out, cradling it like a child. He sits on the edge of the couch, spreads his knees, and settles the guitar against his chest.

"I haven't played for anyone in a long time," he says to the floor.

"I'm not anyone," I say, swiveling my chair to face the console, pulling up a fresh session. I arm a track. I don't look at him. I give him the privacy of my back. "I'm just the tape machine. Pretend I'm not here."

"I can't," he murmurs.

I pause, my hand hovering over the mouse. "Why not?"

"Because you're humming."

I frown. "I'm not humming."

"Your body," he says. "You're vibrating. You're... loud."

I spin the chair back around. He’s watching me again, his eyes dark, unreadable.

"I'm sitting perfectly still, Wolfe."

"Doesn't matter." He strums a chord. G major. It rings out, rich and woody, filling the room. He twists a tuning peg, his ear cocked toward the neck. "You're a live wire, Carmen. I can hear the current."

My mouth goes dry. The nickname—the accusation—hangs in the air.

He strikes the chord again. It’s in tune.

"Record," he commands.

I hit the spacebar. The red light glows.

He doesn't introduce the song. He just starts playing. A fingerstyle pattern, intricate and rolling, like water moving over stones. It’s complex, but his timing is loose. It pushes and pulls. It breathes.

And then he opens his mouth.

The sound that comes out isn't the pretty, melodic folk voice from the old videos. It’s deeper. Broken. It sounds like something tearing.

* "I built a house of driftwood / On a foundation of sand / Waiting for the tide to rise / And take it from my hand..." *

I watch the waveforms paint themselves across the screen. They aren't jagged and erratic like Kyle’s drums. They are sweeping curves. They are mountains.

I close my eyes. I let the sound wash over me. I can hear the scrape of his calluses on the bronze strings. I can hear the tiny, wet sound of his lips parting. I can hear the ghost of a foot tap on the rug.

And beneath it all, I can hear the fear. It’s riding the frequency of his voice, a tremolo of pure panic that he’s forcing into submission.

He’s terrified. And he’s singing anyway.

I open my eyes. He’s watching me while he sings, his gaze locking me in place, daring me to look away. He’s not singing to the room. He’s singing to me.

My skin prickles. My nipples ache. A flush rises up my neck, hot and shaming.

I know, in that moment, that this is going to be a disaster. This man is going to destroy the carefully constructed silence of my life. He is going to rip the soundproofing off the walls.

I should stop the recording. I should kick him out. I should tell Marcus to go to hell.

But the music.

God, the music. It hurts. It’s so good it hurts.

I lean forward, resting my chin in my hand, and let the disaster happen.

"Keep going," I whisper, though I know he can't hear me through the glass of his own storm. "Don't you dare stop."
