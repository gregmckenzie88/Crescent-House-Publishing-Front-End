The kitchen smells like panic and brown butter.

It’s eight-thirty on a Friday night in the North End, which means *Santoro’s* is currently the center of a chaotic universe spinning on the axis of my expo window. The heat in here is a physical weight, a humid blanket woven from steam, shouting, and the aggressive scent of garlic hitting hot olive oil. It’s oppressive. It’s suffocating.

I love it.

"Kevin, if you send me one more plate of rubbery calamari, I am going to feed it to you. Suppository style."

Kevin, my line cook who looks like he’s twelve and smells like he bathes in Red Bull, flinches. He pulls the plate back, his face shiny with sweat. "Sorry, Chef. Two minutes."

"You have sixty seconds," I correct him, wiping the stainless steel counter with a rag that’s seen better days. "Table four is already looking at their watches. I can feel them doing the math on the tip."

I don’t just see the kitchen; I vibrate with it. I know the exact temperature of the oven by the way the heat hits my cheekbones. I know the pasta water needs salt just by the smell of the steam rising from the pot. This is my domain. My fortress. Outside these swinging metal doors, the world is messy and disappointing. Out there, rents are rising, the plumbing in my apartment is groaning, and my mother’s voice is a constant, nagging voicemail on my phone.

But in here? In here, I am God. I control the fire. I control the knife. I control the pleasure of every person sitting in the dining room.

"Service!" I slap a plate of Osso Buco onto the pass. "Run it, Marco. Go."

The runner grabs the plate, and the doors swing open, letting in a brief burst of noise from the dining room—laughter, the clink of silverware, the low hum of Dean Martin crooning from the speakers. It sounds like money. It sounds like survival.

I wipe my forehead with the back of my wrist, leaving a streak of flour on my skin. My hair is a disaster, a dark, curly nest shoved into a bun that’s slowly surrendering to gravity, and my chef’s coat is stained with tomato sauce and olive oil. I probably look like a wreck. I don’t care.

*Control is safety.* The mantra hums in my blood, keeping time with the rhythm of the knives chopping against the cutting boards. *Chop. Chop. Chop.* As long as I am moving, as long as I am shouting orders and tasting sauces, nothing can touch me.

I turn back to the stove, grabbing a spoon to taste the reduction for the special. It hits my tongue—tart, sweet, heavy with fig and balsamic. It’s good. It’s safe.

Then the air pressure drops.

It’s not a sound. The kitchen is too loud for footsteps to register over the roar of the hood vents and the clatter of pans. It’s a feeling. A sudden, violent shift in the atmosphere, like a window has been blown out in a pressurized cabin. The temperature plummets, cutting through the humidity of the kitchen with a razor’s edge of cold.

The hairs on the back of my arms stand up.

I turn slowly, the tasting spoon still in my hand.

The back door, the heavy steel one that leads to the alley where we dump the trash and smoke cigarettes we promised to quit, is open.

A man is standing in the frame.

He shouldn’t fit. The doorway looks suddenly fragile around him, like he could bring the structural integrity of the entire building down just by shifting his weight. He’s wearing a suit that costs more than my car—charcoal wool, tailored to hide things, cut sharp enough to bleed on.

He steps inside, and the door clicks shut behind him, sealing us in.

The kitchen noise seems to dampen, swallowed by the sheer density of his presence. Kevin stops chopping. The dishwasher stops spraying. For a second, the only sound is the hiss of a sauté pan that’s been left on the burner too long.

"Who the hell are you?" I ask. My voice is steady, but my heart does a traitorous, violent kick against my ribs.

He doesn't answer immediately. He scans the room, his eyes moving with a predatory efficiency. He’s not looking at the food. He’s looking for exits. He’s looking for threats. He looks at Kevin, dismisses him as prey, and then his gaze lands on me.

It feels like a physical touch. A heavy, calloused hand gripping the back of my neck.

He walks toward the pass. He moves with a terrifying stillness, no wasted energy, no bobbing of the head or swinging of the arms. He flows like oil.

"Gianna Santoro," he says.

His voice is deep, a subterranean rumble that vibrates through the soles of my non-slip shoes. It’s not a question. It’s an inventory item.

"I’m busy," I snap, tossing the spoon into the sink. It clatters loudly, a tinny sound against the sudden quiet. "If you’re a health inspector, you’re late. If you’re selling something, I’m broke. If you’re looking for the bathroom, it’s out front."

He stops at the end of the counter, three feet away from me. Close enough that I can smell him.

He doesn't smell like the kitchen. He smells like the outside world, but sharper. Cold rain on pavement. Gun oil. Expensive leather. And underneath that, the faint, metallic tang of ozone, like the air right before a lightning strike.

"I’m not here for the bathroom," he says. His face is a ruin of classical architecture—hard planes, a jaw like a granite ledge, and a scar that cuts through his left eyebrow, interrupting the symmetry of what might have been a handsome face if it didn't look so lethal.

"Then get out," I say, leaning forward, bracing my hands on the stainless steel. "This is a working kitchen. You’re violating health codes and my patience."

"Salvatore DiMaggio is dead."

The words land like stones in a pond. Heavy. Final.

I blink. The name scratches at the back of my brain, a dusty memory I’ve spent twenty-eight years trying to sweep under the rug. Salvatore DiMaggio. The ghost. The check that arrived in the mail on the first of every month, signed by a lawyer, never a note, never a card. The sperm donor. The myth my mother used to cry over when she’d had too much wine.

"Okay," I say. I wait for the grief. I wait for the sudden, cinematic drop of my stomach.

Nothing happens. I feel... annoyed. I feel the ticket printer chugging out a new order behind me. I feel the heat of the heat lamps on my forehead.

"Okay?" he repeats. His eyes are dark, almost black, and they narrow slightly. He seems surprised by my lack of collapse.

"He was old," I say with a shrug, turning back to the pass to check a ticket. "People die. What do you want me to do? Send flowers? I don't know the address. I barely knew the name."

"You’re his daughter."

"I’m a chef," I correct him, grabbing a plate of linguine and wiping the rim with aggressive precision. "And right now, I’m in the weeds. So unless you want to put on an apron and start shucking oysters, you need to leave."

The man steps closer. He enters my personal space, violating the invisible bubble I keep around myself in the kitchen. The air around him is colder, sucking the heat out of my skin.

"It’s not a request, Gianna."

"It’s Gia," I hiss. "And everything in this kitchen is my request. My rules."

"Not anymore."

He reaches into his jacket.

The movement is smooth, practiced, but my brain screams *weapon*.

My hand moves before I think. Muscle memory takes over. I snatch the boning knife from the magnetic strip on the wall—a six-inch Wüsthof, razor-sharp, the blade thin and rigid.

I spin, leveling the tip of the knife at his chest.

"Don't," I say.

The kitchen goes dead silent. Kevin drops a pair of tongs.

The man freezes. He doesn't flinch. He doesn't raise his hands in surrender. He just stops, his hand still half-inside his jacket. He looks down at the knife, then up at my face.

And then, he smiles.

It’s not a nice smile. It’s a small, terrifying quirk of his lips that doesn't reach his eyes. It looks like approval.

"You have his temper," he says softly.

"I have a knife," I counter, my voice shaking just a little. Not from fear—though that’s there, a cold snake coiling in my belly—but from adrenaline. A rush of it, hot and electric, spiking through my veins. "And I know exactly where to put it to make you bleed out before the ambulance gets through the tunnel traffic."

He holds my gaze. His eyes are calm, terrifyingly void of panic. He looks at the knife like it’s a toy.

"Put the knife down, Gia."

"Show me your hands. Empty."

Slowly, deliberately, he pulls his hand out of his jacket. He’s holding a thick, cream-colored envelope. He places it on the stainless steel counter between us.

"The will," he says. "And the deed."

"Deed to what?"

"To everything." He leans in, and for a second, the world narrows down to just the two of us. The noise of the kitchen fades into a dull roar. "The estate. The accounts. The legitimate businesses." He pauses, his voice dropping an octave, dragging over my skin like velvet over a bruise. "And the Family."

I stare at him. "I don't want it."

"Bloodright isn't something you want," he says, his voice flat. "It’s what you are. You can stand here and play chef all you want, pretend you’re just a girl from the neighborhood making sauce, but you’re a DiMaggio. And the wolves are already circling."

"Let them circle," I say, keeping the knife steady, though my arm is starting to ache with the tension. "I have a very big walk-in freezer."

He laughs. It’s a dry, rusty sound, like a car engine turning over on a winter morning. "You think you’re tough because you can yell at a line cook? You have no idea what’s coming for you."

"And who are you?" I demand. "The grim reaper?"

"I’m the insurance," he says. "My name is Dante Ferraro. And until the succession is secured, I’m your shadow."

"I don't need a shadow. I have plenty."

"You need me," he says. The arrogance of it stuns me. He says it like a fact. Like gravity. "Because without me, you’ll be dead by Monday."

He taps the envelope with a manicured finger. "Read it. Don't read it. Burn it. It doesn't change the facts."

He straightens up, adjusting his cuffs. The movement draws my eye to his wrists—thick, corded with tendon and muscle, dark ink peeking out from beneath the white starch of his shirt. I have a sudden, flash-bang image of those wrists pinned down, or pinning *me* down.

The thought is so intrusive, so violently sexual, that I almost drop the knife.

Heat flushes up my neck. I tighten my grip on the handle until my knuckles turn white. *What is wrong with me?* The man is threatening my life, invading my sanctuary, and my body is reacting like he’s the main course.

It’s the danger. It has to be. The sheer, massive threat of him. My body is confusing fear with arousal. It’s a biological glitch.

"Get out," I say again, but the words lack the bite they had a minute ago. They sound breathless.

Dante looks at me. Really looks at me. His gaze drops to my mouth, then lowers to where my pulse is hammering visibly in the hollow of my throat. He sees it. He sees the effect he’s having.

His eyes darken, the pupils blowing wide, swallowing the iris. For a second, the mask slips. The "insurance" agent vanishes, and I see the man beneath—starving, violent, and barely leashed.

"I'll be outside," he says.

He turns and walks away, his footsteps silent on the tile. He pushes the back door open, letting in a gust of night air, and then he’s gone.

The vacuum he leaves behind is deafening.

I stand there, the knife still raised, staring at the empty doorway. My chest is heaving. My skin feels too tight for my body, prickly and hot.

"Chef?" Kevin squeaks from the corner. "The... the risotto?"

I look down. The envelope sits on the counter, pristine and heavy. It looks like a bomb.

I lower the knife, my hand trembling now that the threat is gone. I can still smell him. That sharp, metallic scent of rain and violence. It’s stuck in my nose. It’s stuck in my head.

I look at the ticket printer. It’s still spitting out orders. The world hasn't stopped.

"Fire the risotto," I say, my voice sounding strange to my own ears. Rougher. Deeper. "And Kevin?"

"Yeah, Chef?"

"Lock the back door."

#### * * *

The rest of the shift is a blur. I move on autopilot, my body performing the dance it knows by heart—plate, wipe, garnish, sell—but my mind is completely elsewhere. It’s out in the alley. It’s in that envelope sitting in my office safe, where I shoved it immediately after Kevin locked the door.

Every time the front door opens, I flinch. Every time a delivery driver walks past the window, I track them.

*You’ll be dead by Monday.*

Who says that? Who walks into a restaurant on a Friday night and drops a death threat like a napkin?

By the time the last table clears out—a couple on a blind date that went on an hour too long—it’s nearly one in the morning. The kitchen is quiet, stripped down and scrubbed clean. The stainless steel gleams under the harsh fluorescent lights. It usually brings me peace, this moment of restoration. The calm after the storm.

Tonight, the silence feels like a predator holding its breath.

I change out of my whites in the tiny, cramped office in the back. I pull on my jeans and a thick wool sweater, swapping my clogs for boots. I grab my coat and my bag. I hesitate at the safe.

I should leave it here. I should leave the envelope, the will, the ghost of Salvatore DiMaggio locked in a steel box next to the petty cash and the spare keys.

But I can’t.

I spin the dial, the clicks loud in the small room. I grab the envelope. It feels warm, or maybe that’s just my imagination. I shove it into my bag, right next to my knife roll.

I walk out the back door, stepping into the alley.

It’s cold. The damp, bone-deep chill of a Boston November. Puddles of dirty water reflect the yellow streetlights. The smell of the harbor—salt and rotting kelp—mixes with the exhaust from the main road.

I stop.

He’s there.

I knew he would be. I told myself he wouldn't, that he was just a dramatic messenger, but my body knew. My skin starts to hum again, that same low-frequency vibration I felt in the kitchen.

Dante is leaning against the brick wall opposite my door. He’s smoking. The cherry of the cigarette glows bright orange in the shadows, illuminating the sharp angle of his cheekbone and the scar over his eye.

He pushes off the wall as I lock the door. He drops the cigarette and crushes it under the heel of his dress shoe.

"I told you to leave," I say, hugging my coat tighter around me.

"I told you I’m your shadow," he replies. His voice is quieter out here, absorbed by the damp air. "Shadows don't leave just because you close your eyes."

"That’s a very creepy line. You know that, right?"

"I'm not trying to charm you, Gia. I'm trying to keep you breathing."

He walks toward me. In the dim light, he looks even bigger. Broad shoulders that block out the streetlight, legs like tree trunks. He moves to the curb, where a sleek, black sedan is idling. It looks like a shark on wheels.

"Get in," he says. He opens the back door.

"I have a car," I say, pointing toward my beat-up Honda Civic parked three spots down. "And I drive myself."

"Your car is a tin can," he says, dismissing my vehicle with a glance. "And I haven't checked it for explosives."

I freeze. The keys dangle from my fingers. "Explosives?"

"Your father had enemies. You just inherited them. They don't know you refused the call. They just know the bloodline continues." He gestures to the open door of the sedan. "Get in the car. I'll drive you home. We can argue about your independence tomorrow."

I look at my car. It looks innocent enough. A little rusty, a dent in the rear bumper from a parking pole I didn't see. But suddenly, it looks sinister. Is the undercarriage too low? Is that wire hanging down new?

*Control is safety.* But I don't have control anymore. The illusion has shattered.

I look at Dante. He’s waiting, his hand on the top of the open door. His face is impassive, but his eyes are alert, scanning the alley, the rooftops, the street. He is a fortress.

And God help me, I want inside.

I hate him for it. I hate him for making my own world feel unsafe so that he can offer me shelter. It’s a manipulation. I know it is.

"If you try to kidnap me," I say, walking toward him, "I have six knives in my bag."

"I know," he says. As I pass him, I feel the heat radiating off his body. It’s intoxicating. "I counted them when you packed up."

I stop, staring up at him. He’s so tall I have to crane my neck. "You were watching me?"

"I’m always watching you."

He doesn't smile. He doesn't leer. He says it like a statement of fact, like he’s reporting the weather.

I slide into the backseat. The leather is soft and smells like him. He closes the door, sealing me in. The sound is solid, heavy. Safe.

As he walks around the hood to the driver’s side, I watch him through the windshield. He moves with that same liquid grace, adjusting his jacket. I see the flash of a holster under his arm. A gun.

I sink back into the seat, my heart hammering a frantic rhythm against my ribs.

I pull the envelope out of my bag. I run my thumb over the wax seal. The DiMaggio crest. A lion holding a sword.

I trace the shape of the lion.

*Welcome to the jungle, Gia.*

The driver’s door opens, and Dante slides in. The car dips under his weight. He glances at me in the rearview mirror. His eyes meet mine, dark and intense.

"Buckle up," he says.

I buckle up. And for the first time in my life, I have absolutely no idea what’s on the menu.
