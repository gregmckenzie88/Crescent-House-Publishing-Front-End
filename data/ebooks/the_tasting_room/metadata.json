    "under120": "When Sophia Reyes inherits half of California's prestigious Bellacorte Vineyard, she discovers she must share it with Luca Santangelo—Elena's estranged son who views her as an interloper in his family legacy. Forced into an impossible cohabitation clause that requires them to live and work together for twelve months, Sophia finds herself torn between preserving the wine empire she's devoted her life to protecting and resisting her dangerous attraction to the arrogant chef whose mere presence ignites desires she's spent years suppressing.",
    "under240": "When Sophia Reyes discovers she's inherited half of California's prestigious Bellacorte Vineyard, she expects gratitude—not a scorching confrontation with Elena's estranged son, Luca Santangelo. The renowned chef wants nothing more than to sell his inheritance and escape, but Elena's will demands they live and work together for twelve months or lose everything. As accidents plague the vineyard and a ruthless rival circles like a vulture, Sophia finds herself caught between protecting Elena's legacy and surrendering to the dangerous attraction crackling between her and the man who could destroy everything she's worked for. When Luca's protective instincts clash with Sophia's fierce independence, their battles of will become a sensual dance of desire and denial that threatens to consume them both.",
    "logLine": "A wine sommelier and a celebrity chef must live together for a year to inherit a Napa Valley vineyard, but their simmering hatred transforms into explosive passion that threatens everything they're fighting to preserve."
