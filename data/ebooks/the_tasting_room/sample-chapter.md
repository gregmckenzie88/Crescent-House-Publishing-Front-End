The mahogany panels of Morrison, Keller & Associates seem to press closer with each word that falls from the lawyer's mouth. I clutch my purse against my chest like it might shield me from what's coming, but nothing could have prepared me for this.

"To my beloved protégé, Sophia Elena Reyes, I leave fifty percent ownership of Bellacorte Vineyard, including the villa, winery, and all associated assets."

My breath catches. Fifty percent. Not the small bequest I'd hoped for, not even a significant share -- half of everything Elena built. The leather chair creaks as I shift forward, my heart hammering against my ribs.

"And to my son, Luca Alessandro Santangelo, I leave the remaining fifty percent ownership of Bellacorte Vineyard, with all the same rights and responsibilities."

The words hit like a physical blow. Luca. Elena's estranged son who hasn't spoken to her in five years, who abandoned the family legacy for his precious restaurants in the city. The son she never stopped loving despite his cruel rejection.

Mr. Morrison clears his throat, his kind eyes finding mine over his reading glasses. "There is, however, a cohabitation clause."

*No.* The word screams through my mind, but my throat has closed completely.

"Both beneficiaries must reside together at the Bellacorte estate for a period of no less than twelve consecutive months, working jointly to manage the vineyard operations. Should either party abandon the property or fail to fulfill this requirement, their share will revert to the other party. Should both parties fail to meet the terms, the entire estate will be sold and proceeds donated to the Napa Valley Vintners Association."

The room tilts. I press my palm against the cool mahogany table, focusing on the grain of the wood, the faint scent of lemon oil, anything to anchor myself as Elena's final betrayal sinks in. She orchestrated this. From beyond the grave, my mentor -- my surrogate mother -- has forced me into an impossible situation.

"I don't understand." My voice comes out as a whisper. "Elena knew Luca wanted nothing to do with the vineyard. Why would she--"

"Mrs. Bellacorte was very specific about her wishes," Mr. Morrison says gently. "She believed both of you needed each other, though she didn't elaborate on what she meant."

*She meant to torture us.* The thought tastes bitter as wine left too long in the sun. Elena always said the best vintages came from stress -- vines that had to struggle for water, grapes that faced adversity. Maybe she thought the same principle applied to people.

"When does Mr. Santangelo arrive?" I manage to ask.

Mr. Morrison glances at his watch, frowning. "He should have been here twenty minutes ago. His assistant confirmed the appointment."

*Of course he's late.* Even in death, Elena's son can't be bothered to show respect. I think of the last time I saw him, three years ago at the Napa Valley Wine Auction. He'd looked right through me like I was invisible, his green eyes cold as winter fog. The message was clear: I might have his mother's affection, but I would never have his acceptance.

The outer office door slams with enough force to rattle the windows. Heavy footsteps approach, accompanied by a voice I recognize even muffled through the walls -- deep, slightly raspy, speaking rapid Italian into what must be a phone. My stomach clenches with an emotion I refuse to name.

"*Cazzo*, I know I'm late. Handle it." The door to the conference room swings open, and Luca Santangelo fills the doorway like a storm front.

He's bigger than I remembered. Six-foot-two of furious Italian masculinity wrapped in a charcoal suit that probably costs more than I make in a month. His black hair is slightly disheveled, as if he's been running his hands through it, and those penetrating green eyes sweep the room before landing on me with undisguised contempt.

"So you're the little protégé who stole my mother's affections."

The words slice through the air between us. His voice carries traces of an accent that makes my skin prickle despite the obvious hatred behind it. He moves with the controlled grace of someone accustomed to high-pressure situations, sliding into the chair across from me without breaking eye contact.

"Mr. Santangelo," Mr. Morrison begins, "I was just explaining the terms of your mother's will to Ms. Reyes."

"I'm sure you were." Luca's gaze never leaves my face. "Let me guess -- she gets a token amount and a nice letter thanking her for her service."

"Actually--" I start, but he cuts me off with a sharp gesture.

"I don't need to hear your gratitude speech. Whatever she left you, take it and go. I have restaurants to run."

Mr. Morrison clears his throat uncomfortably. "Perhaps I should continue reading the will."

As the lawyer explains the fifty-fifty split, I watch Luca's expression shift from bored indifference to shock to something darker. His jaw ticks with barely controlled rage when Mr. Morrison reaches the cohabitation clause. The temperature in the room seems to drop ten degrees.

"You're joking." Luca's voice is deadly quiet.

"I'm afraid not. Your mother was very specific--"

"My mother," he snarls, "was a manipulative woman who couldn't stand the thought of not controlling everyone around her, even from the grave."

The words hit me like a slap. "Don't talk about Elena that way. She loved you--"

"She loved having a project." His green eyes bore into mine. "First me, then when I disappointed her, you. The perfect little replacement daughter who actually appreciated her suffocating attention."

I'm on my feet before I realize I've moved, my hands flat on the conference table as I lean toward him. "You have no idea what you're talking about. Elena was--"

"Was what?" He stands too, matching my aggressive posture. "A saint? A devoted mother? Tell me, *cara mia*, when was the last time she mentioned me? When was the last time she tried to call?"

The endearment drips with sarcasm, but something about the way he says it sends heat spiraling through my core. I hate that my body responds to him even when he's being cruel.

"She mentioned you constantly," I lie, because the truth -- that Elena rarely spoke of him except when she'd had too much wine -- would only hurt us both.

"Bullshit." He leans closer, and I catch his scent: expensive cologne mixed with something darker, more dangerous. Coffee and leather and something uniquely him that makes my pulse race. "She wrote me off the day I refused to play the dutiful son. The day I told her I'd rather burn the vineyard down than pretend to care about her precious legacy."

"Then why are you here?" The question escapes before I can stop it.

For a moment, something flickers in his eyes. Vulnerability, maybe, or old pain. Then his expression hardens again. "Because fifty percent of Bellacorte is worth approximately twelve million dollars. And unlike you, I don't have the luxury of playing with inherited toys."

The casual cruelty of it steals my breath. Mr. Morrison clears his throat again, looking deeply uncomfortable.

"Perhaps we should discuss the practical arrangements," he suggests. "The will specifies that you must begin cohabitation within thirty days--"

"Absolutely not." Luca's voice cuts through the air like a blade. "I'm not playing house with Elena's pet project. Find a loophole."

"I've reviewed the document extensively," Mr. Morrison says. "It's ironclad. Your mother's attorney was very thorough."

"Then we sell," Luca says flatly. "Split the proceeds and walk away."

"The vineyard isn't just a business," I snap, finding my voice again. "It's a legacy. Elena spent forty years building something beautiful, something that matters. You can't just--"

"Watch me." He straightens his tie with sharp, precise movements. "I'll give you twenty-four hours to find your own legal counsel and review the documents. Then we list the property."

"You bastard." The words escape in a whisper, but they carry clearly in the silent room.

Something dangerous flashes in his eyes. "Careful, *principessa*. You're about to find out exactly what kind of bastard I can be."

The threat hangs in the air between us, loaded with implications that make my skin flush hot and cold at the same time. He turns toward the door, then pauses, looking back over his shoulder.

"One more thing. I'm staying at the house tonight. Consider it a preview of how miserable the next year could be if you're stupid enough to try to force this."

The door slams behind him with enough force to make the diplomas on the wall rattle. I sink back into my chair, my legs suddenly unsteady. Mr. Morrison is saying something about legal options and appeals processes, but his words fade into white noise as my mind races.

*One year. Living with Luca Santangelo for one full year.*

The thought terrifies me almost as much as it thrills me.

#### * * *

The drive from St. Helena to Rutherford usually calms me, but today the familiar curves of the Silverado Trail feel like a countdown to my doom. My hands shake on the steering wheel as I replay every moment of the devastating meeting. The way Luca looked at me like I was something distasteful he'd found on his shoe. The casual cruelty in his voice when he called me Elena's "pet project." The heat that shot through me when he leaned across the conference table, close enough that I could see the flecks of gold in his green eyes.

*God, what's wrong with me?*

I can't stop thinking about that moment when he stood up, all six-foot-two of furious masculinity towering over me. The way his suit jacket pulled tight across his shoulders. The controlled violence in his movements that spoke of barely leashed power. When he called me *principessa*, the word rolled off his tongue like a caress and a threat combined.

My body responded to him. Even while he was destroying everything Elena meant to me, even while he was reducing our shared inheritance to a business transaction, I felt that traitorous flutter low in my belly. The kind of response I've spent years training myself to suppress in professional settings.

*Focus, Sophia. You have bigger problems than your inappropriate attraction to Elena's son.*

But as I turn onto the private road leading to Bellacorte, my mind drifts again to that moment when he leaned over the conference table. His cologne -- something expensive and masculine that probably costs more than my monthly salary -- mixed with the scent of his skin. I found myself wondering what those scarred chef's hands would feel like gripping my hips, pulling me against him. What his mouth would taste like if he kissed me with the same intensity he brought to everything else.

In my fantasy, he doesn't stop at threats. His hands fist in my hair, pulling my head back to expose my throat. "You want to play games, *principessa*?" he whispers against my ear, his accent thicker with arousal. "I'll show you games."

I imagine him lifting me onto the conference table, scattering legal documents as he pushes between my thighs. His mouth claims mine with bruising intensity while his hands make quick work of my professional blazer. "This is what you wanted, isn't it?" he growls against my lips. "To get under my skin, to make me lose control?"

My fantasy spins out in vivid detail -- his hands everywhere, his mouth hot and demanding, the way he'd take complete control and make me beg for more. The way he'd whisper filthy things in Italian while he--

A horn blares behind me, and I jerk back to reality just in time to avoid missing the vineyard turnoff entirely. My heart pounds as I correct course, turning between the stone pillars that mark the entrance to Bellacorte. The familiar sight of the vineyard stretching in neat rows up the hillside usually fills me with peace, but today it feels like I'm driving toward a battlefield.

*Get it together. You're a professional. You've worked too hard to let some arrogant chef with daddy issues derail everything Elena built.*

But even as I give myself the pep talk, I can't shake the memory of how my body responded to Luca's proximity. The way my nipples tightened when he leaned close. The heat that pooled between my thighs when his eyes dropped to my mouth for just a fraction of a second before he caught himself.

He felt it too. I'm sure of it. The same electric awareness that made the air in that conference room feel charged with possibility. The same dangerous attraction that we're both determined to ignore.

*This is going to be pure torture.*

#### * * *

I smell the smoke before I see it.

My foot hits the brake as I round the final curve in the driveway, and Bellacorte's villa comes into view. Gray smoke drifts from the kitchen chimney, which shouldn't be possible because I haven't been here in three days. My pulse spikes as I remember Luca's parting threat: *I'm staying at the house tonight.*

He's already here. Already making himself at home in Elena's sanctuary.

I park next to a sleek black BMW that probably costs more than my annual salary and sit for a moment, trying to gather my courage. The villa looks exactly the same -- honey-colored limestone glowing in the late afternoon sun, weathered shutters framing windows that reflect the vineyard like golden mirrors. But knowing Luca is inside changes everything. The house that's been my refuge for over a decade suddenly feels like enemy territory.

*You belong here,* I remind myself. *Elena wanted you here. She left you half of everything.*

But as I climb the stone steps to the front door, my hands tremble. I fumble with my keys, the metal slipping in my sweaty palms as I try to unlock the heavy wooden door. It swings open before I can manage it.

Luca fills the doorway, and the sight of him steals what little breath I have left. He's changed out of his expensive suit into dark jeans and a black t-shirt that clings to his lean torso. His feet are bare, and somehow that small detail feels impossibly intimate. This is Luca at home, relaxed, without the armor of his professional persona.

He's even more dangerous this way.

"*Principessa*," he says, the endearment no less cutting for being delivered in that honey-rough voice. "Welcome home."

The sarcasm in his tone makes my spine stiffen. "This is my home. Elena left it to me too."

"Fifty percent of it." He steps aside to let me pass, but the doorway is narrow enough that I have to brush against him. The brief contact -- my shoulder against his chest -- sends electricity shooting through my entire body. "I took the master suite. Hope you don't mind."

I spin to face him, my composure finally snapping. "You did what?"

"The master bedroom. My mother's room." His green eyes glitter with malicious satisfaction. "It has the best view of the vineyard, and the en suite bathroom is twice the size of the others. Seems appropriate for the son of the house, don't you think?"

Elena's room. The sanctuary where she'd invite me for late-night conversations about wine and life and dreams. Where she'd let me curl up on her chaise lounge to read while she worked on her journals. The room that still smells like her perfume -- white tea and jasmine -- and holds all her most precious belongings.

"You can't." My voice cracks with emotion. "That's Elena's room. Her things are still--"

"Were still there," he corrects. "I had them moved to the guest room down the hall. You're welcome to sort through them whenever you want."

The casual way he dismisses Elena's memory, the complete lack of sentiment or respect, makes rage build in my chest like steam in a pressure cooker. "How dare you? She was your mother, and you're treating her belongings like they're garbage--"

"She was my mother when it was convenient for her," he cuts me off. "When she needed someone to pose for family photos or charm her business associates. The rest of the time, I was an inconvenience she shuffled off to boarding schools and summer camps."

"That's not true--"

"Isn't it?" He takes a step closer, and I catch that intoxicating scent again -- coffee and leather and something darker that makes my head spin. "Tell me, Sophia, how many times did she mention wanting to reconcile with me? How many times did she say she missed her son?"

The truth is a knife twisting in my chest. Elena rarely mentioned Luca except when she'd had too much wine, and then it was always with a mixture of love and exasperation that made me uncomfortable. She'd made peace with his absence years ago, or at least she'd convinced herself she had.

But I can't tell him that. Can't give him another weapon to use against Elena's memory.

"She loved you," I say instead, which is true even if it's not the whole truth.

"She loved the idea of me. The son who would carry on her precious legacy, who would worship at the altar of Bellacorte wines for the rest of his life." He takes another step closer, backing me against the kitchen island. "But when I chose my own path, when I decided I wanted to create something instead of just preserving what came before, she wrote me off."

I'm trapped between his body and the cool granite, my palms pressed flat against the stone surface. He's close enough that I can see the faint lines around his eyes, the shadow of stubble on his jaw. Close enough to count his eyelashes if I wanted to.

*God help me, I want to.*

"You're wrong about her," I whisper, but my voice lacks conviction. It's hard to think clearly when he's this close, when his body heat is warming the air between us and making my skin hypersensitive.

"Am I?" His voice drops to a rough murmur that makes my pulse flutter. "Or are you just upset because you're realizing the woman you idolized wasn't the saint you thought she was?"

For a heartbeat, his eyes drop to my lips. The moment stretches between us, loaded with dangerous possibility. I can feel his breath on my face, warm and coffee-scented. Can see the pulse beating in his throat. My body sways toward his without conscious permission, drawn by the magnetic pull I've been fighting since the moment he walked into that conference room.

Then he jerks away like I've burned him, putting several feet of distance between us. We're both breathing hard, staring at each other across the kitchen like we've just survived something catastrophic.

"This won't work," he says finally, his voice rough with an emotion I can't identify. "We can't live in the same house for a year. We'll kill each other."

*Or something else entirely,* I think, but I don't say it. Can't say it. Because the something else would be infinitely more dangerous than murder.

"Then leave," I manage to say, though my voice shakes. "Walk away from your inheritance and let me preserve what Elena built."

His laugh is sharp and humorless. "You think I'd make it that easy for you? You think I'd just hand over twelve million dollars because you have pretty eyes and a sob story about preserving legacies?"

"I think you're a selfish bastard who cares more about money than family."

The words hang in the air between us, cruel and final. Something flickers in his eyes -- hurt, maybe, or recognition. Then his expression hardens into the cold mask I'm beginning to recognize as his default armor.

"Then we understand each other perfectly," he says. "One year, *principessa*. Twelve months of hell, and then we sell this place and never have to see each other again."

He turns and walks away, leaving me alone in the kitchen with my racing heart and the lingering scent of his cologne. I hear his footsteps on the stairs, the sound of a door closing with deliberate control.

I sink onto one of the bar stools, my legs too unsteady to support me. My hands are shaking as I press them against my flushed cheeks, trying to cool the fire he's ignited under my skin.

*One year. I have to survive one year of this.*

But as I sit there in Elena's kitchen -- our kitchen now -- breathing in the faint traces of basil and something uniquely Luca, I'm terrified that survival isn't the real problem.

I'm terrified that by the end of this year, I might not want him to leave at all.
