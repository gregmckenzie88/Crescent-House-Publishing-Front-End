The smell hits me first. Dry, ancient dust. The kind that coats the back of the throat and tastes like pulverized brick and old bones.

Then, the darkness. Not the soft, velvety black of a London night, but a heavy, suffocating weight that presses against my eyelids, sealing them shut. The air is too still. The silence is too loud. My lungs seize, refusing to draw breath because there is no air down here, only the recycled carbon dioxide of my own panic.

*I am back in the hole.*

My body reacts before my brain can catch up. I thrash, my limbs tangling in something heavy and confining. A scream claws its way up my throat, a jagged thing that scrapes raw against my vocal cords, but I bite it back. *Quiet. Be quiet or they’ll come back.*

I sit up, gasping, my chest heaving like a bellows.

Cold air hits my sweat-damp skin. Not the dank chill of a Syrian basement, but the sterilized, climate-controlled draft of my apartment in Kensington.

My eyes adjust to the gloom. The gray light of dawn is bleeding through the gaps in the blackout curtains. I am not underground. I am in a bed that cost four thousand pounds, wrapped in Egyptian cotton sheets that feel like spun sugar against my legs.

I force myself to breathe. *In for four. Hold for four. Out for four.*

The panic begins to recede, leaving behind the familiar, hollow ache in my chest. I run a hand over my face, my fingers trembling slightly. My palm comes away wet. Cold sweat. It coats me like a second skin, a reminder that while my body might be safe in Zone 1, my mind is still somewhere near the Turkish border, waiting for a rescue that came three days too late.

I swing my legs out of bed. The floor is hardwood, polished to a mirror shine, cool and solid beneath my bare feet. I need that solidity. I need to feel the ground to know it’s not going to crumble beneath me.

I walk to the en-suite, avoiding my reflection in the floor-to-ceiling mirrors of the wardrobe. I know what I’ll see. The "Fragile Diane." The survivor. The woman who came back from the dead with a scar through her eyebrow and a hollow look in her eyes that makes people lower their voices when I enter a room.

In the bathroom, I turn the shower to the coldest setting. I step under the spray without flinching. The shock of the freezing water creates a gasp that finally fills my lungs. It numbs the skin, quieting the phantom sensation of grit and rough hands.

I stand there until my teeth chatter, until my nipples harden into painful points, until the shivering forces my brain to focus on the *now* rather than the *then*.

This is my life now. Safe. Sterile. Controlled.

I step out, wrapping myself in a plush towel that smells of lavender and expensive detergent. I wipe the steam from the mirror and finally look.

The face staring back is gaunt. The cheekbones are too sharp, cutting against the dark skin like blades. My eyes, usually a deep, warm brown, look flat, reflecting the recessed lighting like obsidian. The scar is a jagged white line bisecting my left eyebrow, a permanent disruption of symmetry. I trace it with a fingertip. It’s numb.

"You're fine," I whisper to the glass. The lie tastes like ash. "You're safe."

I walk into the living room. It’s a showroom, not a home. White leather sofas, glass tables, abstract art that cost more than my parents’ house in Lagos. Everything is white, gray, or chrome. It’s clean. It’s open. There are no dark corners here.

But as I stand in the center of the room, listening to the hum of the refrigerator and the distant, muffled sound of traffic on the High Street, I don't feel safe. I feel displayed.

I am a specimen in a glass jar, preserved for everyone to marvel at. *Look at how well she’s doing. Look at how she functions.*

I hate it. I hate the silence. I hate the safety. It feels less like a sanctuary and more like a waiting room for the next disaster.

#### * * *

The newsroom of *The Chronicle* smells of lukewarm coffee, ozone from overheating servers, and the distinct, sour scent of ambition. It used to be my favorite smell in the world. Now, it just gives me a headache.

I sit at my desk, the ergonomic chair adjusted to the millimeter, staring at the cursor blinking on my screen.

*The Chelsea Flower Show: A Riot of Color in a Gray Spring.*

That’s my headline. That’s my contribution to the Fourth Estate today. Two years ago, I was embedded with a rebel unit in the Congo, writing dispatches that toppled a warlord. Today, I am searching for synonyms for "petunia."

"Diane, love, do you have a sec?"

I don't turn around immediately. I finish typing the word *effervescent* and hate myself a little more. Then I swivel my chair.

Simon, the Features Editor, is leaning against the partition of my cubicle. He’s a soft man—soft hands, soft jaw, soft voice. He wears corduroy jackets and looks at me with the same expression one gives a three-legged dog. Pity mixed with a self-congratulatory patience.

"What is it, Simon?" My voice is crisp, the Received Pronunciation clipped and sharp. I use my accent like a weapon, a way to build a wall between me and the pity.

"Just wanted to check in on the Flower Show piece. We need it for the Sunday supplement."

"It's almost done," I say. "I'm just trying to decide if the begonias were 'radiant' or 'resplendent.'"

He chuckles, a nervous sound that dies quickly. "Right. Good. Listen, Diane... there’s a press junket for that new gallery opening in Shoreditch next week. Champagne, canapés, low stakes. I thought you might enjoy it."

I feel a muscle in my jaw jump. "I put in a request for the G20 summit coverage."

Simon sighs, the sound of a parent disappointing a child. "We talked about this. The G20 is... intense. Long hours, high stress. The doctors said—"

"The doctors signed me off six months ago," I interrupt, my voice dropping an octave. "I am fit for duty, Simon."

"Physical duty, yes. But..." He gestures vaguely towards my head, then realizes how offensive that is and drops his hand. "We just want to make sure you're ready. You’re a valuable asset, Diane. We don't want to break you."

*Break me.*

The words hang in the air between us, vibrating with the fluorescent hum of the lights. He thinks I’m glass. He thinks if he taps me too hard, I’ll shatter into a million jagged pieces on his carpet.

He doesn't know that I already shattered. I shattered in the dark, alone, while men debated my price in a language I didn't speak. What came back wasn't the original vase glued back together. It was something else entirely. Something forged in the fire, harder and colder than before.

"I'll take the gallery opening," I say, turning back to my screen. I can’t look at him anymore. If I look at him, I might scream, and then he’d have his proof.

"Good girl," he says, pushing off the partition.

I type *resplendent* and hit the period key so hard the plastic cap nearly cracks.

My phone rings.

It’s not the internal line. It’s my mobile, vibrating against the hard surface of the desk like a trapped insect. I glance at the screen. *Unknown Number.*

A prickle of unease crawls up my spine. Not panic—this is different. This is instinct. The old instinct, the one that used to keep me alive before I let civilization dull my edges.

I pick it up. "Diane Okonjo."

"Ms. Okonjo? This is Peter Graves from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office."

The sounds of the newsroom—the clatter of keyboards, the low murmur of gossip, the hum of the printer—seem to stretch and warp, pulling away from me until they sound like they’re coming from underwater.

"Yes," I say. My hand finds a pen on my desk. I grip it.

"I’m calling regarding your brother. Tayo Okonjo."

The world stops. It doesn't spin; it just freezes. The cursor on my screen, the dust motes dancing in the light, the breath in my lungs.

"What about him?" My voice is steady. Terrifyingly steady.

"We received a report this morning from an NGO operating near the Krasnovia border. Tayo failed to check in at the rendezvous point yesterday evening. His vehicle was found abandoned two miles from the checkpoint."

*Abandoned.*

The word echoes in my skull. I know what abandoned vehicles look like in that part of the world. Doors left open like broken wings. Bullet holes in the chassis. Blood on the upholstery drying to a rusty brown.

"Where is he?" I ask.

"We don't know yet, Ms. Okonjo. The situation in the border region is... fluid. The separatists have been active in that sector."

"Fluid," I repeat. Bureaucrat speak for *lawless*. "What are you doing to find him?"

"We’ve lodged a formal inquiry with the local authorities. We are monitoring the situation closely."

I grip the pen harder. The plastic bites into my palm. "You lodged an inquiry? With who? The border guards who take bribes to look the other way? The local police who are on the separatists' payroll?"

"Ms. Okonjo, please. I understand you’re upset. But these things take time. We have protocols."

*Protocols.*

I hear a rushing sound in my ears, like the roar of a jet engine. It’s the sound of my own blood.

"Protocols," I say, my voice trembling now, not with fear, but with a rage so hot it feels like it could melt the phone. "Protocols are what you told my parents when I was taken in Aleppo. You told them to wait. You told them to trust the process. And while you were following protocols, I was rotting in a hole for three days."

"That was a different situation," Graves says, his voice tight. "We advise you to sit tight. Do not engage with the media. Do not attempt to contact anyone in the region. It could jeopardize negotiations if... if it comes to that."

"If it comes to that." I let out a short, sharp laugh that makes Simon look up from his desk across the room. "You mean if he’s being held for ransom. Or if he’s being executed."

"Ms. Okonjo—"

"Thank you, Mr. Graves. I’ll wait for your call."

I disconnect.

I stare at the phone in my hand. The black screen reflects my face. I look calm. I look like a woman who just took a call about a dinner reservation.

But under the desk, my legs are vibrating.

*Wait.*

The word is a trigger. It brings back the smell of the earth. The darkness. The feeling of helplessness, of being a pawn in someone else’s game. I waited then. I trusted the systems. I trusted the men in suits to save me.

And they failed.

Tayo is out there. My baby brother. The one with the soft eyes and the bleeding heart who thought he could save the world with vaccines and blankets. He is alone in the cold, surrounded by wolves.

If I wait, he dies.

The realization hits me with the force of a physical blow. It snaps the tension in my chest. The suffocating gray fog that has clouded my brain for two years suddenly clears.

I am not glass. I am not a flower show reporter.

I stand up. My chair rolls back and hits the partition with a loud *thud*.

"Diane?" Simon asks, frowning. "Everything alright?"

I look at him. Really look at him. I see the coffee stain on his tie. I see the fear of confrontation in his eyes. I see a man who has never had to fight for a single breath in his life.

"I'm taking some personal leave," I say.

"What? We have the deadline at four. You can't just—"

"Use the sub-header 'A Symphony of Petals,'" I say, grabbing my purse. "It’s all bullshit anyway."

I walk out. I don't look back. I walk past the rows of desks, past the blinking screens, past the security guard at the lobby who nods at me. I walk out into the gray London afternoon, and for the first time in two years, the air tastes sweet.

It tastes like action.

#### * * *

My apartment is quiet, but it no longer feels like a cage. It feels like a staging ground.

I move with efficiency. No wasted motion. My mind is a flowchart of logistics. *Flight. Gear. Cash. Asset.*

I go to the bedroom, but I don't go to the closet with the silk blouses. I go to the back of the walk-in wardrobe, behind the rows of winter coats I never wear. I kneel down and pry up the loose floorboard in the corner—the one the contractors missed, the one I found the first week I moved in and never fixed.

It’s there. The Go-Bag.

It’s a nondescript black duffel, dusty from disuse. I drag it out. The zip makes a harsh, tearing sound in the quiet room.

I open it. The smell of gun oil and old canvas wafts up. It’s the perfume of my past life.

I check the inventory. Satellite phone (needs charging). Solar charger. First aid kit (morphine ampoules still intact). A burner phone. A passport that says my name is *Amara Diop* and that I’m a French aid worker.

And the cash.

I pull out the thick envelope. Twenty thousand Euros in hundreds. It’s my "fuck off" fund. The money I saved from the hazard pay of a dozen war zones.

It’s not enough. Not for where I’m going. Not for who I need to hire.

I sit back on my heels, the adrenaline humming in my veins. I need a fixer. Not just a driver or a translator. I need a monster.

I need someone who knows the Krasnovia border like the back of his scarred hand. Someone who doesn't care about politics or protocols. Someone who speaks the language of violence fluently.

A name rises from the murky depths of my memory. *Mikhail Volkov.*

I haven't said his name in five years. I haven't let myself think it.

I close my eyes and I can see him. The size of him—a wall of muscle and indifference. The pale, wolf-like eyes that looked at me in that dusty outpost in Donetsk and dismissed me as "baggage."

He saved my life once, incidental to his paycheck. He killed three men in front of me with the casual efficiency of someone taking out the trash, then wiped his knife on his pant leg and asked if I had a cigarette.

He is dangerous. He is toxic. He is exactly what I need.

And I know where to find him. Or at least, I know where he goes to lick his wounds.

I know something else, too. I know about the money he lost in the separatist push of '18. The retirement fund he thinks was burned in a convoy hit. I know it wasn't burned. I know where the account numbers are buried.

It’s a bluff. I don't have the codes. But I know enough to make him listen. And if I can get him to listen, I can get him to move.

I stand up, grabbing the bag. I strip off my office clothes—the pencil skirt, the silk blouse, the heels that pinch my toes. I dress for travel. Cargo pants. Merino wool base layer. Heavy boots.

I catch my reflection in the mirror again. The woman staring back isn't the fragile victim anymore. Her eyes are hard. Her jaw is set. The scar on her brow looks less like a defect and more like a warning.

I pull out my laptop and open a browser. I type in the flight search.

*London Heathrow to Warsaw.* One way.

I hover over the 'Confirm' button.

My heart is hammering against my ribs, a frantic, bird-like rhythm. This is insanity. I am walking away from safety. I am walking back into the fire that almost consumed me. I am going to a place where law is a suggestion and life is cheap.

But the alternative is staying here. The alternative is waiting by the phone while Tayo bleeds out in the snow.

The alternative is suffocating in this glass cage until I forget how to breathe entirely.

I press the button.

*Booking Confirmed.*

I zip the bag shut. The sound is final.

"I'm coming, Tayo," I whisper.

I shoulder the bag. It’s heavy, dragging on my shoulder, pulling me down. But as I walk to the door, I realize it’s the first time in years I’ve felt weightless.
