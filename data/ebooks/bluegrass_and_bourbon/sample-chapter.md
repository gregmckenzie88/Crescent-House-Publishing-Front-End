The phone screams. 

It’s not a ring; it’s a violation. The sound slices through the thick, humid air of my bedroom, dragging me up from the bottom of a dreamless, exhausted void. My hand shoots out, a reflex honed by a decade of on-call shifts, slapping the nightstand until fingers find plastic.

"Dr. Osei." My voice is a rusty hinge, but the title is automatic. It’s the armor I put on before my feet hit the floor. 

"Answering service, Doctor. Sorry to wake you." The operator sounds bored, chewing on a vowel. "Got a frantic one. Booker Distillery. Says they have a carriage horse down, thrashing. Sounds like colic."

Booker Distillery. That’s out past Versailles. Forty minutes of winding back roads in the pitch black.

"Name?" I ask, already sitting up, swinging my legs out of the sheets. The air in the room is heavy, wet, clinging to my skin instantly. My AC unit is a breathless wheeze in the window, fighting a losing war against the Kentucky summer.

"Elijah Booker. He says to hurry."

"Tell him I’m en route. Tell him to keep the animal walking if he can, but do *not* get in the stall if the horse is violent. Do you have that?"

"Walking. Not violent. Got it."

I hang up. The screen glows 2:14 AM. 

For three seconds, I sit on the edge of the mattress, head in hands. The resentment is a physical thing, a bitter pill dissolving under my tongue. Two years ago, I wouldn't be taking calls at two in the morning for a carriage horse at a failing distillery. Two years ago, I was the lead surgeon at Thorne Equine. I had interns. I had a climate-controlled office. I had respect.

Now I have a Ford F-150 with a suspicious rattle in the transmission and a client list composed of backyard breeders and desperate farmers who pay in cash.

*Get up, Amara. Dignity doesn't pay the rent.*

I dress in the dark. Sports bra, tank top, scrub top. Jeans that are sturdy enough to deflect a hoof but tight enough not to snag on fencing. I pull my hair back into a bun so severe it pulls at my temples. I need the tightness. It keeps my face smooth, my expression unreadable. 

Outside, the night is a mouth. It swallows me whole. The humidity is absolute, a tangible weight that presses against my lungs. It smells of wet asphalt, decaying honeysuckle, and the deep, loamy rot of the earth. The cicadas are screaming, a deafening, rhythmic buzz that sounds like electricity arcing.

I climb into the truck. The cab smells of stale coffee and antiseptic—the perfume of my new life. I turn the key, wincing as the engine coughs before catching. 

As I pull out onto the road, the headlights cut a tunnel through the darkness. The trees on either side form a canopy, their leaves drooping with moisture. I drive fast. Not because I care about the distillery owner’s panic—panic is cheap; everyone has it—but because competence is the only currency I have left. If I save the horse, I get paid. If I save the horse, I am still Dr. Osei. 

I turn up the radio to drown out the cicadas, but the static is just as loud. My mind drifts, dangerous and unbidden, to the sterile white walls of the surgical suite I lost. The memory is a phantom limb; I can still feel the cool air on my skin, the weight of the scalpel, the hush of the gallery. 

*Stop it.*

I grip the steering wheel until my knuckles ache. The past is a sunk cost. The present is a colic case on a dark road. Focus on the medicine. Focus on the gut sounds. Focus on the paycheck.

I am a mechanic of flesh and bone. Nothing more.

#### * * *

The Booker Distillery rises out of the mist like a ruin. 

It’s not one of the polished, Disney-fied tourist traps on the main trail. There’s no gleaming welcome center, no manicured hedges. It’s a sprawl of dark brick and weathered wood, industrial and imposing. The rickhouses—massive, windowless warehouses where the barrels sleep—loom like monoliths against the purple-black sky. 

Even inside the truck, with the windows up, I can smell it. The angel’s share. The ethanol vapor escaping the barrels, mixing with the sweet, heavy stench of cooking corn and damp oak. It’s a smell that gets into your pores, intoxicating and earthy.

I navigate the gravel drive, tires crunching loudly. A single floodlight illuminates a barn set away from the main production buildings. The barn doors are thrown wide open, spilling yellow light onto the dirt.

Chaos radiates from the opening.

I kill the engine and grab my med bag. The humidity hits me again, harder this time, laden with the smell of manure and fear.

"Easy! Goddamnit, easy!"

The voice is deep, ragged, and straining. 

I jog toward the light. Inside the barn, the air is choked with dust and straw. In the center aisle, a battle is losing its structure.

The horse is a Percheron mix, massive, black, and slick with sweat. He’s not walking; he’s trying to throw himself to the ground, his eyes rolling white in terror. Colic pain is unlike anything else—it’s a twisting, necrotic agony in the gut that makes flight animals try to run from their own bodies.

And hanging onto the lead rope, using his entire body weight as an anchor, is a man.

He’s sliding in the dirt. He’s tall, broad through the shoulders, wearing a t-shirt that’s soaked through, clinging to his back like a second skin. He’s not wearing gloves. His boots dig furrows into the earth as the horse rears, front hooves striking the air with lethal force.

"Walk on!" the man roars, his voice cracking. He yanks the lead, forcing the horse’s head down, turning him in a tight circle to keep him from dropping and rolling. If the gut twists, the horse is dead.

I stop for a microsecond, assessing. 

Most owners are useless in a crisis. They weep, they get in the way, they get hurt. But this man—Elijah, I assume—is moving with a brutal, efficient grace. He’s not panicking; he’s working. His forearms are corded with tension, veins standing out like roadmaps as he fights twelve hundred pounds of pain-crazed animal.

He turns, and for a second, the light catches his face. Stubble darkens his jaw, sweat dripping from his chin. His eyes are wide, adrenaline-blown, the color of burnt sugar. He looks wild, dangerous, and utterly exhausted.

He sees me. "Don't just stand there!" he barks. "Do something!"

The rudeness doesn't touch me. I prefer it to politeness. It’s honest.

"I need you to hold him still, Mr. Booker," I say, my voice projecting clearly over the scuffling hooves. I step into the stall, moving with deliberate slowness. Sudden movements are a death sentence here. "I'm going to sedate him. Can you keep his head down?"

"I'm trying," he grunts, teeth gritted as the horse jerks him sideways. Elijah’s shoulder slams into a support beam, a dull thud that makes me wince, but he doesn't let go. He doesn't even flinch. He just leverages his weight back, planting his feet, turning his body into a counterweight. 

I respect the physics of him. 

"Okay," I say, approaching the horse’s left shoulder. The animal is steaming, heat radiating off his flank like an oven. I can smell the sour distress in his sweat. "I'm coming in. Watch the strike zone."

I pull a pre-loaded syringe of Detomidine from my pocket. I always load before I walk in. 

"On three," I command. "Yank the head to the left. Expose the jugular groove."

Elijah doesn't ask why. He doesn't argue. He nods, a sharp jerk of his chin. 

"One. Two. Three."

He hauls back on the halter. The horse fights, throwing his head up, but Elijah anticipates the move, dropping his center of gravity and pulling down. The neck is exposed for a fraction of a second.

I strike. 

It’s not a gentle motion. You have to be firm. I slap the neck to desensitize the skin, then drive the needle in. Blood flashes in the hub—dark red, venous. Good. I depress the plunger.

"Done," I say, stepping back quickly. "Give it two minutes."

The horse is still fighting, kicking out at his own belly. Elijah is breathing hard, his chest heaving. We are standing three feet apart in the dust and the noise, and the air between us feels charged, like the atmosphere before a thunderstorm breaks.

"Is he going to make it?" Elijah asks. He doesn't look at me; his eyes are fixed on the horse. His voice is lower now, scraping against the bottom of his register.

"Let the drugs work," I say clinically. "Then I'll tell you."

I watch him. He’s stroking the horse’s neck now, a rhythmic, soothing motion that contrasts sharply with the violence of a moment ago. His hands are large, the knuckles battered, grease or oil stained into the cuticles. They are working hands. Hands that build things. Hands that fix things.

I look away, annoyed by the sudden, sharp spike of heat in my belly. It’s just adrenaline. It’s the biology of a crisis. 

The horse’s head begins to droop. The knees buckle slightly. The sedative is hitting the brainstem, turning the panic into a slurry of confusion.

"He's going down," Elijah warns, his muscles bunching to hold the weight.

"Let him stand," I order. "Keep him on his feet. If he rolls now, we lose."

Elijah moves in closer to the animal, using his shoulder to prop up the horse’s head. "Hey now," he murmurs. The tone is different—intimate, rumbling. It vibrates through the floorboards. "Stay with me, big man. Stay on your feet."

I step forward. "I need to tube him. Check for reflux. If his stomach has ruptured, there’s nothing I can do."

Elijah looks at me then. Really looks at me. His eyes are intelligent, assessing. He takes in the severe bun, the stained scrubs, the way I’m holding the nasogastric tube like a weapon.

"Tell me what you need," he says.

"I need you to be a post," I say. "Don't let him move his head. Not an inch."

"Do it."

I lubricate the tube. The smell of the lube is chemical and slick. I guide the end into the horse’s nostril. This is the part they hate. The horse snorts, flinching, trying to toss his head.

Elijah’s arm clamps down over the horse’s nose, trapping it against his chest. He doesn't use cruelty; he uses absolute, unyielding pressure. He is a wall.

"Swallow," I whisper to the horse, advancing the tube. "Come on. Swallow."

I feel the resistance, then the give as the horse swallows the tube into the esophagus. I push it down, hand over hand, watching the neck for the tube’s passage.

"You're in," Elijah says softly. He saw it. He noticed the bulge in the throat. Observant. 

"Almost there." I push the remaining length until I hit the stomach. I put my mouth to the end of the tube and blow, listening for the rush of air, the smell of gastric contents. 

The smell hits me—sour, fermenting grain. But no rush of fluid. The stomach isn't ruptured. It's an impaction. A blockage.

"He's blocked," I say, straightening up. "I need to pump fluids. Water, electrolytes, mineral oil. We have to flush him out."

"I have water here," Elijah says, nodding toward a hose. 

"Hook it up to my pump." I gesture to the bucket I brought in.

For the next hour, we work in a rhythm that shouldn't be possible for two strangers. I mix the slurry of oil and salts; he manages the water line. I monitor the horse’s heart rate; he monitors the horse’s mood. 

It’s hot. Oppressively, dangerously hot. The barn is an incubator. Sweat is running down my back, pooling at the waistband of my jeans. My hair is frizzing, escaping the bun, sticking to my neck.

Elijah is worse. His shirt is translucent with sweat, clinging to the definition of his chest and abdomen. He smells of hard labor—salt and musk and the sweet, cloying scent of the mash from the distillery. It’s a raw, masculine scent that cuts through the antiseptic and manure.

At one point, I reach for the mineral oil jug just as he does. Our hands brush.

His skin is calloused, rough like unfinished wood, but radiating a startling amount of heat. The contact is electric—a static shock that zips up my arm and settles heavily in my chest. 

I snatch my hand back. "I've got it."

He pauses, his hand hovering in the air for a fraction of a second too long. He looks at me, his gaze dropping to my mouth, then snapping back to my eyes. "Right."

He backs off, giving me space. But the air has shifted. The crisis is fading, the adrenaline is ebbing, and what’s left in its wake is something stickier, more dangerous.

We pump five gallons of fluids into the horse. I pull the tube, a long, messy process that leaves slime on my scrubs. The horse shakes his head, groggy but standing. His gut sounds are returning—faint gurgles and pings that sound like music to me.

"He's stabilizing," I say, wiping my hands on a towel. "The oil should move the blockage. You'll need to walk him every two hours until he passes manure."

Elijah lets out a breath, a long exhale that seems to deflate his entire frame. He leans back against the stall wall, sliding down until he’s crouching, forearms resting on his knees. He looks wrecked.

"Thank you," he says. He doesn't look at me; he’s looking at the horse. "He’s... he’s one of the few things around here that isn't broken."

"He's not out of the woods yet," I say, my voice clipped. I’m packing my bag, organizing my instruments. Control. I need control. "I'll leave you a dose of Banamine. If he starts thrashing again, call me immediately."

"You're leaving?"

I look up. He’s watching me from his crouch. The shadows cut across his face, highlighting the sharp angle of his cheekbone, the heaviness of his brow.

"I have rounds at seven," I lie. I don't have rounds until nine. I just need to get out of this barn. I need to get away from the smell of him, the heat of him.

Elijah stands up. He unfolds slowly, towering in the small space. He walks toward me, and I have to force myself not to step back. He stops a foot away. Too close. I can feel the warmth radiating off him.

"I didn't catch your name," he says. His voice is a low rumble, like a barrel rolling over a wooden floor.

"Dr. Osei," I say. "Amara."

"Amara," he repeats. He tastes the name, testing the weight of it. The way he says it—slow, deliberate, rolling the 'r'—makes my skin prickle. It sounds intimate. It sounds like a claim.

"Mr. Booker," I nod, slinging my bag over my shoulder. "I'll bill you."

"Elijah," he corrects. "And I'm sure you will."

He walks me to the truck. The sky is beginning to bruise with pre-dawn light, a deep, majestic purple bleeding into the black. The humidity hasn't broken. If anything, it’s heavier, pregnant with a storm that hasn't arrived yet.

I toss my bag into the passenger seat and climb in. Elijah stands by the door, one hand resting on the open window frame. His fingers are long, dirty, capable. I have a sudden, vivid image of those hands on my skin—rough, demanding, holding me down the way he held the horse.

The thought is so sharp, so visceral, that I almost gasp. I shove the key into the ignition.

"Walk him," I say, staring straight ahead through the windshield. "Every two hours."

"I know the drill," he says softly. 

I start the truck. The engine rattles, breaking the silence. I don't look at him as I put it in gear. I can feel his eyes on me, heavy and physical, watching me drive away.

As I turn onto the main road, leaving the smell of mash and oak behind, I realize my heart is hammering against my ribs. Not from the emergency. Not from the medicine.

From him.

I roll down the window and let the wet, heavy air rush in, slapping my face.

*Professional,* I tell myself. *You are professional.*

But as I drive back toward the city, my hand drifts to my neck, fingers touching the pulse point that is beating too fast, betraying me in the dark.

#### * * *

The adrenaline crash hits me about ten minutes from home.

It’s a physical drop, leaving me hollowed out and vibrating. My hands on the steering wheel feel light, disconnected from my wrists. This is the part of the job they don't show on the glossy brochures for vet school—the comedown. The moment when the life-or-death urgency evaporates and you're just a woman in a dirty truck, smelling of stomach bile and another man’s sweat.

I pull into the parking lot of my apartment complex. It’s a "luxury" complex, which means they put granite countertops in the kitchens and charge three hundred dollars extra, but the walls are paper-thin and the gate is broken half the time. It’s sterile. It’s safe. It’s temporary.

Everything in my life is temporary now. I am simply waiting for the penance to be over.

I kill the engine and sit in the silence. My phone buzzes on the passenger seat.

It’s a text from an unknown number.

*He’s walking. Gut sounds are loud enough to wake the dead. Thanks again. - Elijah*

I stare at the screen. The blue light is harsh in the dark cab. He shouldn't have my personal cell number—the answering service patches calls through. He must have pulled it from the invoice I left on the tack trunk, or maybe he asked the service and charmed it out of them with that voice that sounds like gravel and molasses.

I should be annoyed. It’s a breach of protocol. Clients don't text the doctor unless it’s an emergency.

I type back: *Good. Keep monitoring.*

I hesitate, my thumb hovering over the send button. It’s too cold. Too robotic. Even for me.

I delete it.

*Glad to hear it. Call if anything changes.*

Send.

Safe. Professional. Detached.

I climb out of the truck, my boots scuffing on the asphalt. My body feels heavy, pulled down by gravity and exhaustion. I need a shower. I need to scrub the smell of the Booker Distillery off my skin. I need to wash away the memory of Elijah’s eyes, the way they tracked the sweat rolling down my neck.

My apartment is cool and quiet. It smells of lemon cleaning spray and nothing else. No mash. No earth. No life.

I strip off my clothes in the bathroom, leaving a pile of denim and cotton on the tile. I catch my reflection in the mirror. My eyes look huge, dark pools in a tired face. There’s a smear of grease on my collarbone.

I step into the shower and turn the water as hot as I can stand.

Steam fills the stall, blinding me. I lean my forehead against the cool tile, letting the water beat against my shoulders. I close my eyes, and instantly, I’m back in the barn.

I can feel the heat of the horse. The tension in the air.

I can see Elijah’s arms, the muscles jumping as he fought for control. I can feel the phantom pressure of his body next to mine, the radiating warmth that seemed to pull me in like a gravity well.

*I need you to be a post,* I had told him.

*Tell me what you need,* he had answered.

The words replay in my head, stripped of their medical context. 

*Tell me what you need.*

My hand moves down my stomach, slick with soap. I shouldn't. I’m tired. I have work in four hours. But my body is humming, a low-frequency vibration that demands an answer.

I slide my fingers between my legs. I am swollen, sensitive. The reaction is instantaneous, a sharp intake of breath that echoes in the tiled space.

I think of his hands. Rough. Dirty. Strong.

I imagine them gripping my hips instead of a halter. I imagine that low, commanding voice telling me to stay still, to take it.

*Don't move. Not an inch.*

I gasp, my hips bucking forward against my own touch. It’s quick, shameful, and explosive. I come with a ragged cry that gets lost in the sound of the falling water, my knees shaking, my forehead pressed hard against the tile until it hurts.

When it’s over, I stand there trembling, the water running cold.

I wash my hair. I scrub my skin until it’s pink and raw. I rinse away the sweat and the desire and the shame.

I step out, wrap myself in a towel, and walk into my sterile, quiet bedroom. I check my phone one last time.

No new messages.

I lie down, staring at the ceiling fan cutting lazy circles in the dark. The silence of the apartment presses in on me, lonely and vast.

I am Dr. Amara Osei. I am competent. I am in control.

But as I drift toward sleep, the smell of charred oak and rain lingers in my nose, a ghost I can't quite exorcise. And I have the sinking, terrifying realization that the armor I’ve spent two years building might have just developed a crack.
