My life is a grid. It has x-axes and y-axes, rows and columns, debits and credits. If something doesn’t fit into a cell, I reject it. I delete the anomaly. I balance the ledger.

Chaos is just bad math.

I align the edge of the Manila folder with the exact corner of my desk. Perfect right angle. The beige metal of the filing cabinet to my left gleams under the fluorescent lights, a monolith of organized data. The air in here—my sanctuary on the second floor of a walk-up on Brighton Beach Avenue—smells of dust, printer toner, and the aggressive lemon scent of the cleaning wipes I buy in bulk.

It smells like control.

"Miri, *bubeleh*, you look like a funeral director. Put on some lipstick."

The chaos enters stage left.

My mother, Yelena, breezes into my office, bringing with her a cloud of heavy floral perfume that wars with my lemon disinfectant. She is wearing a leopard print scarf that costs more than my health insurance and carrying a plate of rugelach that is currently shedding crumbs onto my pristine floor.

"I am a forensic accountant, Ma," I say, not looking up from the file I’m auditing. "Funeral directors have more fun. They deal with dead bodies. I deal with dead money."

"You work too hard." She sets the plate down. Right on top of the quarterly projections for the bakery downstairs.

My eye twitches. Just a micro-spasm in the lower lid. I reach out and move the plate to a coaster, then brush the invisible sugar granules from the document with the back of my hand.

"I work exactly the right amount," I correct her. "And please don't put food on the work product. Grease stains are unprofessional."

"You know what is unprofessional? Dying alone with only your cats to eat your face."

"I don't have cats. I have spreadsheets."

"Same thing. Both cold, both ignore you." She sighs, the dramatic, suffering exhale of a Jewish mother who has been waiting for grandchildren since I turned twenty-one. She leans a hip against my desk, picking at a loose thread on her coat. "Are you coming for Shabbat dinner? Mrs. Shapiro’s son is in town. He’s a podiatrist."

"I have a meeting," I lie. Well, half-lie. I have a meeting now, at 2:00 PM, but Friday night is days away. I just can't handle the setup. "And I don't need a podiatrist. My feet are fine."

"Everyone needs a podiatrist, Miri. You wear those sensible shoes. They stifle the soul."

I look down at my loafers. They are Italian leather, expensive, and ergonomic. They are shoes for a woman who needs to walk quickly through the city to catch a train, not teeter on the boardwalk looking for a husband.

"I have to go, Ma." I stand up, smoothing the front of my charcoal blazer. It’s boxy, intentionally cut to hide the shape of my waist, the curve of my hips. I don't like being looked at. I like being listened to. "I have a consultation with the IRS Criminal Investigation Division."

That shuts her up. The acronyms usually do. In this neighborhood—Little Odessa, where the Soviet Union collapsed and reconstituted itself next to the Atlantic Ocean—the IRS is the boogeyman.

"The government?" Her voice drops, her eyes darting to the window as if the Feds are rappelling down the brickwork. "Why? What did we do?"

"We didn't do anything. They hired me. I'm the consultant, remember?" I walk around the desk and kiss her cheek. Her skin is soft, papery, smelling of Pond's cold cream and secrets. "I help them catch the bad guys who forget to carry the one."

She grips my arm, her fingers surprisingly strong. Her nails are painted a garish red, chipped at the edges. "Be careful, *dochka*. The government... they are not our friends. They are just a bigger gang."

"I'm fine. It's just an audit."

I pull away gently. I grab my briefcase—hard shell, combination lock—and check my reflection in the darkened monitor of my computer.

Hair pulled back so tight it pulls at my temples. Glasses clean. No makeup aside from concealer under my eyes to hide the insomnia. I look severe. I look competent. I look like a woman who cannot be surprised.

I am lying to myself, of course. But it’s the only way I can walk out the door.

#### * * *

The wind off the Atlantic cuts through my coat like a rusted knife. Brighton Beach in November is a study in grayscale. The elevated subway tracks rattle overhead, a deafening rhythmic thunder that shakes the fillings in your teeth. Below, the street is a slurry of slush and trash.

I step over a puddle that reflects the neon Cyrillic sign of the pharmacy next door. *APTEKA*. Everything here is dual-language, dual-identity. We are Americans, but we eat smoked fish wrapped in newspaper and drink tea with black cherry preserves.

I check the address on my phone again. *The Romanov*.

I frown. The IRS agent, a Special Agent Miller, suggested the location. Usually, I meet them at the Federal Building in Manhattan, or a sterile coffee shop with bad lighting. *The Romanov* is one of those high-end Russian steakhouses on the boardwalk where the vodka flows like water and the clientele wears sunglasses indoors.

Maybe Miller is trying to be culturally sensitive. Or maybe he’s expensing a lobster lunch.

I push through the heavy oak doors, and the sensory shift is instantaneous. The roar of the subway and the bite of the wind vanish, replaced by a wall of humid warmth and the smell of dill, roasting lamb, and expensive, heavy cologne.

The lighting is dim, amber-hued, designed to flatter aging oligarchs and their young mistresses. Red velvet booths line the walls, separated by frosted glass partitions etched with eagles. A balalaika plays softly over the speakers—something melancholy and traditional.

A hostess with cheekbones sharp enough to cut glass and eyes that say she’s seen things that would make a priest weep blocks my path.

"Reservation?" she asks, not looking at me, but at the scuff on my briefcase.

"I'm meeting someone. Mr. Miller."

Her eyes flick to me then. A micro-expression of confusion, followed by a smooth mask of indifference. "Coat check is to the left. You cannot wear that wet thing inside."

I bristle. "I'll keep it. I’m not staying long."

She shrugs, a fluid motion of one shoulder. "Suit yourself. Private Room 4. In the back."

Private room?

My internal alarm bells, usually a low hum, spike to a shrill ring. IRS agents do not book private rooms. They do not conduct government business in the back of mob-adjacent steakhouses.

*Turn around, Miri. Go back to the office. Email him.*

But I don't turn around. Because I am Miriam Feldman, and I don't run from irregularities. I investigate them. I tighten my grip on my briefcase handle until my knuckles turn white, straighten my spine, and march past the main dining floor.

The corridor to the private rooms is lined with black-and-white photos of Old Russia. Tsars, peasants, snowy landscapes. It feels like walking into a mausoleum.

Room 4 is at the end. The door is heavy mahogany.

I don't knock. I’m the auditor. I’m the one who asks the questions.

I push the door open and step inside, ready to give Agent Miller a lecture on appropriate meeting venues.

"Agent Miller, I really don't think this is approp—"

The words die in my throat. They turn to ash and choke me.

There is no Agent Miller.

The room is small, intimate. A round table set with white linen. A bottle of vodka—*Jewel of Russia*, the Ultra Limited edition—sits in a bucket of ice.

And sitting in the high-backed leather chair, facing the door, is a wolf in a bespoke suit.

He doesn't stand up. He just watches me enter, his stillness absolute. He is massive, taking up too much space even while sitting. Broad shoulders encased in fabric that looks like liquid midnight. A jawline that could crack granite. His hair is dark, cropped short on the sides, slightly longer on top, brushed back with severe precision.

But it’s the eyes. Slate gray. Flat. Cold as the ocean in winter.

I know those eyes.

I haven't seen them in fifteen years, not since high school, not since he was a lanky, silent boy who sat in the back of AP Calculus and stared at the blackboard like he wanted to dismantle the equations with his teeth.

Nikolai Volkov.

*Kolya.*

The air leaves the room. My lungs seize.

"Close the door, Miriam," he says.

His voice is a physical thing. It vibrates through the floorboards, travels up through the soles of my sensible Italian loafers, and settles low in my belly. It is deep, textured with gravel and a faint, rolling accent that he hasn't bothered to scrub away.

I don't move. My hand is still on the brass doorknob. My brain is frantically trying to reconcile the data. *Variable: IRS Audit. Outcome: Bratva CFO.* The equation is broken.

"I... I have a meeting," I stammer. I hate that I stammer. I hate that my voice sounds thin and reedy, like a child's. "With a federal agent."

"There is no Agent Miller," he says calmly. He lifts a hand—large, scarred across the knuckles, but manicured—and gestures to the empty chair opposite him. "Sit."

"I'm leaving."

"You aren't."

It’s not a threat. It’s a statement of fact. Like saying gravity exists.

He picks up a crystal shot glass, the light catching the liquid inside. "If you leave, the IRS actually *will* audit you. And your mother. And that bakery she keeps afloat with creative accounting and prayers."

My feet freeze.

He knows.

"Sit," he repeats. Softer this time. More dangerous.

I release the doorknob. My palm is damp. I walk to the chair, my movements stiff, jerky. I feel like a marionette whose strings are being pulled by a drunk puppeteer. I sit down, placing my briefcase on the floor, keeping it touching my leg. An anchor.

"Nikolai," I say. Testing the name. It tastes like metal.

"Kolya," he corrects. He pours a second shot of vodka and slides it across the linen tablecloth toward me. "You used to call me Kolya."

"I used to lend you pencils. We aren't friends."

"No," he agrees. His eyes traverse my face, slow and thorough. It feels like a physical touch, a thumb dragging across my cheekbone, down my throat. I suppress a shiver that has nothing to do with the temperature. "We are not friends. Friends are liabilities."

"What do you want?" I ask. I fold my hands on the table to stop them from trembling. "If this is about your family's taxes, I can't help you. I work for the prosecution, Volkov. I put people like you in prison. I don't help you deduct your ammunition expenses."

A ghost of a smile touches his lips. It doesn't reach his eyes. "Sharp. You were always sharp. I remember you in school. You always had ink on your fingers. You smelled like vanilla and pencil shavings."

The intimacy of the observation hits me like a slap. I lean back, trying to put distance between us. "Is this a reunion? Because I bill hourly, and you can't afford me."

"I can buy this entire block, Miriam. I can buy the air you are breathing."

He reaches down to the floor beside his chair and lifts a thick Manila folder. It looks identical to the ones in my office, innocent and beige.

He slides it across the table. It stops inches from my folded hands.

"Open it."

I hesitate. My heart is hammering against my ribs, a trapped bird. *Open the box, Schrödinger. See if the cat is dead.*

I flip the cover open.

It’s not tax returns. It’s not a ledger.

It’s a series of photos. Grainy, surveillance-style.

My mother entering a basement casino on Coney Island Avenue. My mother laughing with a man who has a neck tattoo. My mother signing a marker. My mother handing over a check—a check from the bakery’s business account.

I flip the page. Copies of promissory notes. IOUs.

The numbers are staggering. Fifty thousand. One hundred thousand.

The red ink screams at me.

"She has a gambling problem," Kolya says. His voice is devoid of judgment, which somehow makes it worse. It’s clinical. "She plays poker. Badly. She borrows money. Stupidly."

"This..." I swallow the bile rising in my throat. "This is fake. She goes to Bingo."

"She goes to Viktor’s tables," he says.

Viktor. Viktor Volkov. His uncle. The head of the family. The man whose name is whispered in Brighton Beach like a curse.

"She owes the family two hundred and fifty thousand dollars," Kolya says. "The debt is past due. Viktor is... traditional. He believes in physical collateral."

The room spins. The amber lights blur. I grip the edge of the table, my fingernails digging into the wood. My mother. My foolish, chaotic, loving mother. She didn't just mess up a spreadsheet. She sold our lives.

"Why are you showing me this?" I whisper. "If you want the money, I... I have savings. I have a retirement fund. I can liquidate—"

"I don't want your money, Miri."

He leans forward. The scent of him—sandalwood, cold air, and something dark and musky—washes over me. He is too close. He is eclipsing my world.

"Then what?"

"I want your brain."

I blink, confused. "What?"

"I want out," he says. The words are low, dropped like stones into a deep well.

I stare at him. "Out? Out of what? The Bratva?"

"The life. The business. All of it." He picks up his vodka, downs it in one smooth motion, and sets the glass down with a sharp *clink*. "But one does not simply resign from my family. One must buy their freedom."

"I don't understand."

"I have been skimming," he says. "For three years. Moving money from Viktor’s accounts into secure offshore holdings. Building a war chest. But Viktor is getting suspicious. He has ordered an internal audit. If he finds the discrepancies, he will kill me. And then he will kill anyone who ever knew me."

He looks at me then, and for a second, the flat gray of his eyes cracks. I see something behind the slate. Desperation? No. Determination. A terrifying, singular focus.

"I need you to fix the books," he says. "I need you to cook the ledgers so perfectly that even the Devil couldn't find the missing millions. I need you to buy me time."

"You want me to commit fraud," I say, my voice rising. "You want me to aid and abet a federal crime. I am a consultant for the IRS! I am the good guy!"

"You are a daughter," he counters smoothly. He taps the photo of my mother. "Viktor knows about the debt. He was going to send a collection team to the bakery tonight. I stopped him. I told him I would handle it."

"You..."

"I bought her debt, Miriam. Now she owes me."

He leans back, the predator who has just closed the trap.

"You fix my books. You help me disappear. And I wipe her debt clean. I burn the markers."

"And if I say no?"

He doesn't answer immediately. He just watches me. I feel the weight of his gaze on my skin, heavy and hot. It’s not just intimidation. It’s something else. Something that makes the breath hitch in my throat and my thighs clench involuntarily beneath the table.

"Then I cannot protect her," he says softly. "And you know what Viktor does to people who steal from him."

I do know. Everyone in the neighborhood knows.

I look down at the photos. My mother’s smiling face. Her chaos. Her vulnerability.

I look at my hands. Clean. Manicured. Ink-stained from my favorite pen.

I have spent my entire life building a fortress of order. I have categorized every risk, calculated every variable, insured myself against every disaster. I thought I was safe because I was boring.

But the variable I didn't account for is sitting across from me, wearing a five-thousand-dollar suit and looking at me like I am the only water in a desert.

"I need access," I hear myself say. My voice sounds distant, like it belongs to someone else. "If I’m going to do this... if I’m going to hide millions of dollars from a sociopath... I need full access to the raw data. No redacted files. No bullshit."

Kolya’s eyes darken. A flicker of something—approval?—flares in the gray depths.

"You'll have it."

"And I do it my way. I don't work at your headquarters. I don't go to the club."

"You will work where I tell you to work," he says, his voice dropping an octave, turning into a growl that vibrates in my chest. "You are under my protection now, Miri. Which means you are within my reach. At all times."

My pulse leaps. Fear. It has to be fear.

"I have a job," I argue weakly. "I have a life."

"You had a life," he says. He stands up. He is enormous, a towering wall of shadow and heat. He reaches across the table, and for a terrifying second, I think he is going to grab my throat.

Instead, he picks up the folder and tucks it under his arm.

"Now," he says, "you have me."

He walks to the door, pausing with his hand on the latch. He looks back over his shoulder.

"Be ready at 8:00 AM tomorrow. I’ll pick you up."

"I didn't agree yet!" I shout, standing up, my chair scraping loudly against the floor.

He looks at me, and the corner of his mouth lifts. A real smile this time. Dark, jagged, and terrifyingly handsome.

"You balanced the equation the moment you sat down, Miriam. You just haven't written the answer yet."

He walks out.

I am left alone in the private room. The smell of him lingers—sandalwood and danger.

I look at the empty shot glass he left behind. I look at my hands. They are shaking violently.

I sit back down. I pick up the bottle of *Jewel of Russia* and pour myself a shot. I don't drink vodka. I drink herbal tea.

I toss it back. It burns like fire. It burns like a warning.

I pull my phone out and cancel my appointments for tomorrow. Then I open my calendar app.

*8:00 AM: Audit.*

I stare at the word. It looks innocuous. Safe.

But I know better. I’m not auditing a company. I’m auditing a monster.

And the terrifying part—the part I will not admit, not even to the silence of this room—is that for the first time in ten years, I’m not bored.

I’m terrified.

And I’m alive.
