The air in *The Sapphire Sovereign* tastes like recycled gin, desperate ambition, and the specific, cloying vanilla of floor polish used to hide the scent of chain-smokers. It’s a cocktail I’ve been breathing for eight months, and it coats the back of my throat like a second skin.

"Sweetheart, you missed a spot."

The hand lands on my hip, heavy and damp. It’s attached to a man wearing a suit that costs more than my entire life’s earnings, his wrist weighed down by a gold Rolex that ticks loud enough to rival the slot machines.

I don't flinch. Flinching draws attention. Flinching makes you real.

I turn, plastering on the smile I practiced in the mirror of three different foster homes—the one that says *I am delighted to serve you* but stops just short of *I am actually listening*.

"So sorry," I say, my voice pitched an octave higher than my natural register. I wipe the condensation ring from the mahogany table with a quick, circular motion. "Better?"

He grins, teeth capped and white, eyes dropping to the neckline of my uniform. The corset is too tight, pushing my breasts up like an offering on a platter. "Much better. Maybe you can help me with my luck later? I’m down ten grand."

*Ten grand.*

The number flashes in my head in neon green. Ten grand is a new identity. Ten grand is a studio apartment in Seattle where the rain washes everything clean. Ten grand is safety. To him, it’s a bad Tuesday.

"I’m sure it’ll turn around," I lie. "The house only wins until it doesn't."

I slip away before he can slide a chip into my cleavage, weaving through the labyrinth of the main floor. I am a ghost in fishnets. I have perfected the art of sliding through crowds without touching a single soul. I move with an economy of motion learned from years of dodging angry foster fathers and grabby step-brothers. Keep the elbows in. Eyes down, but peripheral vision wide. Be fluid. Be nothing.

My tray is empty, but my mental ledger is full.

I have twelve thousand dollars stashed in the hollowed-out vent behind the toilet in my studio apartment. It’s a pitiful amount for a life, but it’s enough for a bus ticket and three months of rent in a city where no one knows the name Maren Cole.

*Just two more shifts,* I tell myself, the mantra rhythmic with the clicking of the roulette wheels. *Two more shifts, and I’m gone.*

I reach the service bar, sliding my tray onto the sticky rubber mat. The noise here is a physical weight—the electronic chime of slots, the roar of the craps tables, the generic pop music pumped in to keep heart rates elevated. It’s sensory assault designed to liquefy judgment.

"Maren!"

Jerry, the floor manager, snaps his fingers at me. He’s a man who sweats even in the hyper-cooled air conditioning, his forehead perpetually slick.

"Yeah, Jerry?" I lean against the bar, shifting my weight to relieve the burning in the balls of my feet.

"VIP wing. The Sovereign Suite. They called down for a refill on the Beluga and a clean-up. Housekeeping is backed up on the fourth floor."

My stomach tightens. "I’m floor service, Jerry. I don’t do the suites."

"You do what I tell you to do, or you clock out. Permanently." He shoves a silver tray into my hands, loaded with a fresh bottle of vodka and a stack of linen napkins. "Room 88. The keycard is on the tray. Go."

I look at the tray, then at Jerry’s red, agitated face. I could walk. I could walk right now, go home, grab the cash from the vent, and disappear.

But twelve thousand isn't fifteen thousand. Fifteen is the safety net. Fifteen is the buffer against the inevitable disaster.

*Survival Rule #1: Don’t burn a bridge until you’re standing on the other side.*

"Fine," I say, taking the tray. The bottle of Beluga is heavy, cold against my palm. "But I’m taking my break after."

"Yeah, yeah. Just don't make eye contact unless they ask you to."

I turn toward the elevators, the service entrance that leads to the high-roller wing. The noise of the casino floor fades as the heavy brass doors slide shut, sealing me in with my own reflection. I look tired. The dark circles under my eyes are bruising purple beneath the concealer. My blonde hair is pulled back so tight it pulls at my temples, severe and practical.

I look like exactly what I am: a woman holding her breath.

#### * * *

The eighth floor is a different world.

When the elevator doors open, the cacophony of the casino is severed, replaced by a silence so profound it makes my ears pop. The air here is colder, crisper, smelling of ozone and expensive leather. The carpet changes from the gaudy, stain-hiding patterns of the main floor to a plush, blood-red velvet that swallows the sound of my heels.

I walk down the corridor, the tray balanced on my fingertips. It’s a long hallway, lined with sconces that cast jagged shadows against the cream-colored walls.

There are no guards.

I pause, a prickle of unease crawling up my spine. Usually, the VIP wing is crawling with security—ex-military types with earpieces and necks thick enough to stop a shovel. But the hallway is empty. The silence feels heavy, expectant.

*Turn around,* a voice whispers in my head. It’s the voice of the scared little girl who hid in closets, the one I thought I suffocated years ago.

*Don’t be stupid,* the adult Maren counters. *Rich men don’t like guards watching them do lines of coke off high-priced escorts. Just drop the vodka, grab the dirty glasses, and get out.*

I count my steps. One, two, three. I focus on the money. The money is real. The fear is just a reflex, a phantom limb from a past life.

I reach the double doors of the Sovereign Suite. They are mahogany, carved with lions, imposing and arrogant.

I balance the tray on one hand and slide the keycard into the slot. The light blinks green.

I don’t knock. Jerry said they called for service. Rich people hate waiting, and they hate being interrupted by the pleasantries of the help. They just want the magic to happen.

I push the door open.

"Room service, I have the—"

 The words die in my throat, choked off by a sudden, violent paralysis.

The suite is massive, a sprawling expanse of gold leaf and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the neon scar of the Strip. But I don't see the view.

I see the plastic sheeting spread over the Persian rug.

I see the man on his knees. He’s wearing a suit that’s been ruined, the fabric dark and wet. His hands are zip-tied behind his back, and his face is a ruin of bruising, one eye swollen shut, his mouth a bloody gash.

And I see the monster standing over him.

He is huge. That’s my first coherent thought—a primitive assessment of mass and threat. He stands over six-four, broad-shouldered in a charcoal suit that fits him like armor. His back is to me, his posture relaxed, almost bored.

He holds a knife. It’s not a kitchen knife or a switchblade. It’s a tool. Matte black, curved, efficient.

The man on the floor looks up. He sees me. His good eye widens, a desperate, pleading white rim in a mask of red. He opens his mouth, maybe to scream, maybe to beg.

"Please," he gurgles.

The monster moves.

It happens so fast my brain can’t process the sequence, only the result. It’s not a fight. It’s not a struggle. It is a retraction of permission to exist.

The man in the charcoal suit steps forward, grabs the kneeling man’s hair, and jerks his head back. The knife flashes—a dark blur against the neon light of the window.

*Schlick.*

The sound is wet. Terrible and wet. Like stepping in a puddle in canvas shoes, but louder.

Blood sprays. It arcs through the air in a hot, dark ribbon, splashing against the plastic sheeting, speckling the pristine white cuffs of the killer’s shirt.

I stop breathing. The tray in my hand feels suddenly weightless, as if gravity has suspended its rules to watch this horror.

The kneeling man gurgles, a horrible, bubbling sound, and then he slumps forward. Dead weight. Meat.

The killer stands there for a beat, watching the body fall. He doesn't pant. He doesn't shake. He takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes the blade with slow, methodical strokes.

Then, he turns.

I should run. My legs should be pumping, my lungs screaming. But I am frozen, rooted to the plush carpet by a terror so absolute it overrides biology.

He looks at me.

He has a face carved from granite and cold winters—high cheekbones, a jaw sharp enough to cut glass, a mouth set in a grim, straight line. But it’s his eyes that pin me to the wall.

They are ice blue. Not the color of the sky, but the color of a glacier—deep, ancient, and utterly devoid of mercy.

There is no surprise in them. No panic at being discovered. He looks at me with the clinical detachment of a wolf spotting a rabbit that has wandered too far from the burrow.

Time stretches. I see the splatter of blood on his cheekbone, a stark contrast to his pale skin. I see the way his hand tightens on the knife handle—not in a threat, but in preparation.

And God help me, in the deepest, darkest recess of my lizard brain, a synapse misfires.

Beneath the terror, beneath the bile rising in my throat, I notice the sheer, overwhelming power of him. The absolute control. He is a natural disaster in a bespoke suit. He is death, and he is looking right at me.

*Run,* my mind screams, finally breaking through the static. *Run or die.*

The killer takes a step toward me.

The spell breaks.

I drop the tray.

The crash is deafening—glass shattering, the heavy bottle of vodka exploding against the floor, the smell of alcohol mixing instantly with the metallic tang of blood.

The noise seems to startle him, just for a fraction of a second. His eyes flicker to the mess on the floor.

That fraction is all I get.

I spin on my heel, my shoe slipping in the puddle of vodka. I scramble for traction, my hand grasping the doorframe, propelling myself backward into the hallway.

"Wait."

His voice is deep, a rumble that I feel in my chest rather than hear. It is a command, not a request.

I don't wait.

I bolt.

#### * * *

I run like I’ve never run in my life.

I kick off my heels as I turn the corner, leaving them abandoned on the red carpet. The velvet is rough against my stockinged feet, but I don't care. I need speed. I need friction.

My breath comes in ragged, tearing gasps. *Get to the elevator. Get to the stairs. Get out.*

The silence of the hallway is now my enemy. I can hear him behind me. I don’t need to look to know he’s coming. I can feel his pursuit like a heat source on the back of my neck. He won’t be running. Men like that don’t run. He will be stalking, striding with those long, powerful legs, closing the distance with terrifying inevitability.

I hit the service elevator button, slamming my fist against it over and over.

*Come on. Come on.*

The numbers above the door are frozen on the first floor. It’s too slow. He’ll be here before it arrives.

I abandon the elevator and sprint for the stairwell door at the end of the corridor. My lungs burn. My heart is hammering against my ribs so hard I think it might crack the bone.

I hit the crash bar on the door with my shoulder, bursting into the concrete stairwell. The air here is stale and dusty.

I don't go down. Down is where security is. Down is where he expects me to go.

I go up.

I scramble up the concrete steps, taking them two at a time, my hands clawing at the railing to pull myself faster. I need to get to the roof? No, the roof is a trap. I need to get to the mechanical floor. The maintenance level.

I hear the door below me open.

It’s a quiet sound. Controlled. The hiss of the pneumatic closer.

Then, footsteps.

*Click. Click. Click.*

Hard-soled shoes on concrete. Slow. Rhythmic.

"There is nowhere to go, *myshka*."

The voice echoes up the stairwell, bouncing off the concrete walls. It sounds calm, almost soothing. The Russian word means nothing to me, but the tone is unmistakable. It’s the tone a man uses when he has the leash in his hand.

I clap a hand over my mouth to stifle the sob that tries to claw its way out. tears blur my vision, hot and stinging.

*Think, Maren. Think.*

I reach the landing for the ninth floor. Maintenance.

I yank the door open and slip inside, letting it close as softly as I can.

I’m in a labyrinth of pipes and ductwork. The hum of the massive HVAC units is deafening here, a mechanical roar that masks the sound of my breathing. It’s dark, lit only by emergency caged bulbs that cast yellow, sickly pools of light.

I move deeper into the shadows, squeezing between two massive silver ducts. The metal is cold against my back. I slide down, curling into a ball, pressing my knees to my chest.

I am shaking so hard my teeth chatter. I bite my lip until I taste copper, forcing myself to be still.

I close my eyes, and the image is there, burned into my retinas.

The knife. The blood. The way he looked at me.

He wasn't angry. He wasn't frantic. He was... inevitable.

And beneath the terror, that sick, twisted part of me—the part that learned long ago that power is the only thing that matters—shivers. Not just with fear.

I saw his hands. Large, scarred, steady. Hands that could snap a neck or...

*Stop it.*

I dig my fingernails into my palms, grounding myself in the pain. *He is a killer. He just slaughtered a man in front of you. He is going to kill you.*

The door to the maintenance floor opens.

The roar of the machinery doesn't change, but the air pressure shifts. I feel it.

He is here.

I hold my breath, my heart a trapped bird battering against a cage of bone. I squeeze my eyes shut tight, praying to a God I stopped believing in when I was seven years old.

*Make me invisible,* I beg. *Make me nothing.*

But as the heavy, deliberate footsteps vibrate through the metal floor grating, getting closer and closer to my hiding spot, I realize the truth.

I am not invisible anymore.

I have been seen. And now, I am his.
