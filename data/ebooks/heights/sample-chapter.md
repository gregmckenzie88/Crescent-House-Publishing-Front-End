The drop of water hits my forehead with the precision of a Chinese water torture device. It’s cold, rusty, and smells faintly of copper and neglect.

I don’t wipe it off. I can’t. My hands are currently occupied gripping a wrench that is slick with condensation, trying to tighten a U-bend that should have been replaced when the Twin Towers were still standing.

"It’s really about community synergy," Rob says. His voice drifts into the supply closet from the main office, loud and self-satisfied. "I told the board, we need to think about vertical integration of our youth programs."

I grit my teeth so hard my jaw aches. *Vertical integration.* He heard me say that on a conference call three weeks ago. He didn’t know what it meant then, and he certainly doesn't know what it means now, but he’s using it to charm the socks off a donor from the Upper West Side who thinks giving fifty bucks to the Castillo Community Center counts as an anthropological expedition.

I give the wrench one final, violent shove. Metal screeches against metal, a sound like a dying animal, and the dripping finally stops.

I slide out from under the industrial sink, my spine scraping against the raw concrete floor. The air in the supply closet is thick enough to chew, a humid soup of floor wax, bleach, and the damp, earthy rot of old mops. It’s ninety-two degrees in Washington Heights today, and the center’s AC unit is currently wheezing its last breath, rattling in the window frame like a smoker with emphysema.

I stand up, brushing dust off my black slacks. There’s a wet patch on my shoulder where the pipe leaked, and my blouse is clinging to my back with sweat. I look like a wreck. I look like the help.

Which, technically, I am.

I walk into the main office. Rob is leaning back in his chair—*my* chair, actually, the ergonomic one I bought with my own money because the center-issued one was giving me sciatica—with his feet up on the desk.

"Exactly," Rob says into his cell phone, winking at me as I walk in. "Carmen and I were just discussing that. I’ll have her send over the revised budget. Great. Chao."

He hangs up and beams at me. He has the kind of smile that suggests he thinks he’s doing the world a favor just by existing. "Great news, Carm. The Hendersons are in for the gala."

"That’s great, Rob," I say, my voice flat. I move to the filing cabinet, needing to do something with my hands before I strangle him. "Did you mention the plumbing grant? The deadline is tomorrow."

"Oh, I didn't want to overwhelm them," he says, waving a hand dismissively. "Besides, I figured you’d handle the paperwork. You’re the wizard, right? The magic maker."

*The magic maker.* That’s code for "the woman who does my job so I can leave at three o'clock for happy hour."

"I need you to sign the check for the electrician," I say, pulling a folder from the stack on his desk. "He won’t come back until we pay the balance."

"Just forge it, babe. You know my signature better than I do."

He stands up, checking his reflection in the darkened window. He adjusts his tie, a garish blue thing that clashes with his shirt. "I’m heading out. Meeting a potential sponsor at Locksmith."

"It’s two-thirty," I say.

"Networking never sleeps, Carmen." He pats my shoulder as he passes, his palm damp and heavy. "Hold down the fort."

The door jingles as he leaves. The rush of heat from the street hits me—exhaust fumes, frying oil, and the thumping bass of a passing car—before the door slams shut, sealing me back in the silence.

I stand alone in the office. The silence isn't peaceful; it's heavy. It presses against my eardrums. I look at the pile of grant applications on the desk—the ones I wrote, the ones Rob will sign. I look at the flickering fluorescent light overhead that buzzes like an angry hornet.

I am twenty-eight years old. I have a Master’s degree in Public Administration. I speak three languages. And I am currently the invisible woman.

I sit down in the chair Rob vacated. The leather is still warm from his body. I shudder, a visceral recoil, and stand back up. I’d rather stand until my feet bleed than sit in his warmth.

I walk over to the window that looks out onto St. Nicholas Avenue. The glass is hot under my fingertips. Outside, the Heights is alive. It’s a riot of color and noise, a living, breathing organism that doesn't care about budgets or leaking pipes. Old men are playing dominoes on a folding table outside the bodega, the *slap-slap-crack* of the tiles audible even through the glass. A woman is pushing a stroller with one hand and holding a melting *piragua* with the other, shouting happily at someone across the street.

I feel a phantom ache in my chest, a hollowness that has nothing to do with hunger. It’s the feeling of being a ghost in my own life. Watching the world through glass. Keeping the structure standing while everyone else lives inside it.

*You chose this,* a voice whispers in my head. *You wanted to be useful. You wanted to be safe.*

Usefulness is a trap. It’s a golden cage where you get patted on the head and fed scraps of praise while your soul slowly atrophies.

I turn back to the desk. I pick up a pen. I have a grant to finish.

#### * * *

The change in the atmosphere happens before the door even opens.

It’s a shift in air pressure, a sudden drop in the ambient noise of the main room outside my office. The kids playing ping-pong in the rec room go silent. The radio that’s always blasting salsa at the front desk cuts out.

It’s the kind of silence that happens when a predator enters a clearing.

I look up from my paperwork, my heart doing a strange, stuttering double-tap against my ribs.

The door to my office opens. It doesn't fling open, and no one knocks. It just opens, steady and inevitable.

A man steps inside.

He has to duck slightly to clear the frame. He is tall, broad in a way that gym memberships can’t manufacture—a genetic solidity that suggests he could walk through a wall if he couldn't find a door. He’s wearing a suit, charcoal gray, tailored so perfectly it looks like it was poured over his skin. In a neighborhood of basketball shorts and knock-off jerseys, he looks like a sleek, dangerous weapon sheathed in Italian wool.

Rafael Castillo.

I haven't seen him in person in five years, not since he went away to business school—or whatever euphemism the family used for "learning how to launder money more efficiently." He’s older now. The softness of his twenties has been carved away, leaving sharp angles and a jawline that looks like it could cut glass.

He closes the door behind him. The click of the latch is the loudest sound in the world.

"Ms. Reyes," he says.

His voice is a physical thing. It’s a baritone rumble that seems to vibrate through the floorboards, traveling up the soles of my shoes. It’s not loud, but it commands the air in the room, sucking up all the oxygen.

"Mr. Castillo," I manage. My voice sounds thin, reedy. I clear my throat, straightening my spine. I will not be intimidated in my own office, even if my office is a glorified closet and he is... him. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"

He doesn't answer immediately. He walks further into the room, his eyes scanning the space. He takes in the peeling paint in the corner, the stack of unpaid invoices on the filing cabinet, the fan oscillating uselessly in the corner. He looks at these things not with judgment, but with a clinical, terrifying assessment. He is calculating the value of everything in this room.

Including me.

His gaze lands on me, and I feel the heat of it like a physical touch. He starts at my face, drops to the wet stain on my shoulder, lingers on the way my blouse sticks to my stomach, and then returns to my eyes. It’s not a lecherous look. It’s worse. It’s a look of total comprehension. He sees the sweat, the exhaustion, the frustration I keep buttoned up behind my cardigan.

"Is Henderson here?" he asks. He knows the answer.

"He’s at a meeting," I say. "I can take a message."

"I didn't come to see Henderson."

He moves toward the desk. I have the sudden, irrational urge to back up, to put distance between us, but the window is behind me. I’m trapped between the glass and the wolf.

He stops in front of the desk. He doesn't sit. He looms.

"My family is launching an education initiative," he says. No preamble. No small talk. "STEM programs. Coding bootcamps. Scholarships for local students to CUNY schools. We’re looking for a partner organization to administer the funds."

My brain stutters. "That sounds... expensive."

"Five million for the initial endowment," he says calmly. "With an annual operating budget of two million."

The number hangs in the air, glittering and impossible. Five million dollars. That’s enough to fix the roof. To replace the plumbing. To hire actual teachers instead of relying on burnt-out volunteers. It’s enough to save this place.

It’s also Castillo money.

"And what does the Castillo family want in return?" I ask, my voice sharper than I intended. "We’re a 501(c)(3), Mr. Castillo. We can’t exactly help you move product."

His eyes narrow, just a fraction. The temperature in the room drops ten degrees. "We want legitimacy, Carmen. We want the neighborhood to thrive. A thriving neighborhood is good for business."

He uses my first name. It sounds illicit in his mouth, a secret whispered in the dark.

"And why come to me?" I ask. "Why not the YMCA? Why not the Boys and Girls Club?"

"Because they are inefficient," he says. He places a folder on the desk. His hand is large, his fingers long and square-tipped. A gold watch glints at his wrist—Patek Philippe, understated, worth more than my annual salary. "And because you are the only person in this zip code who knows how to actually get things done."

My breath hitches. It’s a direct hit to my solar plexus. *He sees me.*

"I’ve read your grant proposals," he continues, his voice lowering, turning into velvet gravel. "The ones Henderson signs. I know who does the work here. I know who keeps the lights on while he’s drinking at Locksmith."

He leans forward, placing his hands on the edge of the desk. He is close now. I can smell him—sandalwood, expensive tobacco, and the crisp scent of starch. It’s a clean, masculine smell that overrides the scent of floor wax and failure.

"I don't work with people who take credit for other people's labor," he says. "I want to work with the architect. Not the facade."

My heart is hammering against my ribs so hard I’m afraid he can see it. This is dangerous. He is dangerous. The Castillos are the reason half the mothers in this neighborhood pray the rosary at night. They are the shadow over the Heights.

But looking at him, feeling the sheer force of his focus directed entirely at me, I don't feel fear. Or rather, I do, but it’s tangled up with something else. Something hot and heavy that pools low in my belly.

It’s the competence. It’s the absolute certainty in his voice. He isn't asking me; he’s telling me. He’s stripping away the bureaucracy and the bullshit and speaking directly to the part of me that is starving for power.

"I need to review the terms," I say, trying to keep my voice steady. "I can't just... agree."

"I’m not asking you to agree today," he says. "I’m asking you to read it."

He pushes the folder toward me. I reach for it. Our fingers brush.

A shock of static electricity snaps between us. I jerk my hand back. He doesn't flinch. He doesn't even blink. He just watches me, his eyes dark and unreadable.

"You have a leak," he says, nodding toward my shoulder.

"I fixed it," I say defensively.

"I know," he says. A ghost of a smile touches his lips. It’s not a nice smile. It’s a knowing one. "You fix everything, don't you, Carmen?"

He straightens up, the spell breaking slightly as he reclaims his height.

"Read the proposal," he says. "I’ll be back on Thursday. Have an answer."

He turns and walks out. He doesn't look back.

I stand there, staring at the closed door, my chest heaving like I’ve just run a sprint. The room feels suddenly massive and empty without him filling it.

I look down at the folder. It’s heavy, black matte cardstock. Embossed on the front is a simple logo: *Castillo Development Group.*

I touch the spot on my hand where his skin grazed mine. It still tingles, a phantom burn.

I should throw this in the trash. I should call the board and tell them we’re being targeted by organized crime. I should run in the opposite direction.

I open the folder.

#### * * *

The walk home is a sensory assault, but for the first time in years, I welcome it.

I need the noise. I need the chaos to drown out the sound of Rafael Castillo’s voice replaying in my head.

I navigate the sidewalk of St. Nicholas Avenue like a dancer, sidestepping a spilled crate of mangoes, dodging a group of teenagers filming a TikTok, weaving through the dense crowd of commuters pouring out of the 168th Street station. The sun is setting, casting the neighborhood in a bruised purple light. The streetlights are flickering on, humming with electric potential.

Bachata blasts from a parked Honda Civic—*thump-thump-ting, thump-thump-ting*—the rhythm syncing with my heartbeat. The air smells of charred meat from the kebab cart, the sweet, cloying scent of caramelized nuts, and the underlying metallic tang of the subway grates.

It’s sticky. My blouse is ruined, plastered to my back. My hair, pulled back in its severe bun, feels heavy and tight against my scalp. I want to rip the pins out. I want to stand under a cold shower until I’m numb.

But my mind won't shut off.

*I want to work with the architect. Not the facade.*

He knew. He knew about Rob. He knew about the grants. He had been watching.

The thought should terrify me. The Castillos don't watch people for benevolent reasons. If they’re watching you, it means you’re either a threat or an asset. And assets are owned.

I stop at the corner, waiting for the light to change. To my left, the George Washington Bridge stretches across the river, a steel gray giant connecting us to the rest of the world. It looks different tonight. Usually, it looks like an escape route. Tonight, it looks like a gate.

And Rafael is the gatekeeper.

I think about his hands. They were rough. I saw the callouses when he placed the folder on the desk. They were the hands of a man who has done manual labor, who has built things, broken things. Not soft, manicured CEO hands.

I imagine those hands on the folder. Then I imagine them on the desk.

Then, traitorously, I imagine them on me.

The image hits me with the force of a physical blow. I picture him gripping my waist, his thumbs pressing into my hip bones, moving me out of his way—or moving me exactly where he wants me. I imagine the roughness of his palm against the sensitive skin of my throat, tipping my head back, forcing me to look at him.

*You fix everything, don't you?*

What if I didn't?

The thought is a seduction. What if, for once, I wasn't the one holding the wrench? What if I wasn't the one keeping the water from flooding the building? What if I let go, and let someone else take the weight?

Someone strong enough to hold it. Someone like him.

A horn honks, jarring me back to reality. The light has changed. I cross the street, my heels clicking a frantic rhythm on the asphalt.

I’m losing my mind. It’s the heat. It’s the exhaustion. It’s the fact that I haven't had sex in two years because every man I meet is either intimidated by my job or bored by my stories about zoning regulations.

Rafael Castillo is a criminal. Or at least, his father was, and his cousin is. He is part of a machine that chews up neighborhoods like this and spits out bones. Taking his money would be a deal with the devil.

But five million dollars.

I turn onto my block. The brownstones here are older, the stoops crowded with neighbors cooling off in the evening air. Mrs. Rodriguez waves at me from her window on the first floor.

"Carmen! *Mija*! You look tired!" she yells.

"Long day, Doña Rosa!" I call back, forcing a smile that feels like it’s going to crack my face.

"You work too hard! You need a husband!"

I almost laugh. If only she knew who I was just thinking about. If I brought Rafael Castillo home, Doña Rosa would probably faint, then cross herself, then ask him to fix her radiator.

I unlock the front door of my building. The lobby smells of Pine-Sol and boiled cabbage. I trudge up the three flights of stairs to my apartment, my legs feeling like lead.

Inside, I drop my bag on the floor. I kick off my shoes. I don't turn on the lights. I walk straight to the window and look out.

From here, I can see the skyline. I can see the new luxury condos rising near the river, glass towers that reflect the sunset like fire. Rafael lives in one of those, I’m sure. High up. Above the noise. Above the smell of cabbage and trash.

I pull the black folder out of my bag. I shouldn't read it. I really shouldn't.

I trace the embossed letters with my thumb. *Castillo.*

It feels like a summons.

I walk into the kitchen, pour myself a glass of tap water, and sit down at my small, wobbly kitchen table. I open the folder.

The first page is an executive summary. The formatting is impeccable. The font is crisp. The language is precise, devoid of the fluff and jargon I spend my life wading through. It’s a battle plan disguised as a charity proposal.

*Objective: To create a sustainable infrastructure for academic and professional advancement within Washington Heights, independent of municipal gridlock.*

Independent. Control.

He wrote this. I can hear his voice in the cadence of the sentences. Low, direct, unyielding.

I read the whole thing. I read it twice.

By the time I look up, the apartment is dark. The streetlights outside cast long, orange shadows across the floor.

It’s brilliant. It’s predatory, aggressive, and completely brilliant. It would work. It would actually work.

I lean back in my chair, the folder resting on my lap like a loaded gun.

He wants a partner. He wants the architect.

I feel a smile tug at the corner of my mouth. It’s a sharp, dangerous thing, a smile I haven't worn in a long time.

He thinks he can buy me. He thinks he can walk in with his suits and his sandalwood scent and his five million dollars and own me, just like his family owns half the storefronts on Broadway.

He’s right about one thing: I am the wizard. I am the one who makes the magic happen.

If he wants to play with the architect, he’s going to have to learn that I don't just build things.

I know how to demolish them, too.

I close the folder.

Thursday.

I’ll be ready.
