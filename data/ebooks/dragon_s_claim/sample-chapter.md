The heat in the kitchen of The Golden Phoenix isn’t just a temperature; it’s a physical weight, a humid, garlic-scented palm pressing down on the back of my neck.

"Table four needs the General Tso’s. Now."

My voice cuts through the roar of the industrial wok burners, sharp and devoid of the exhaustion dragging at my eyelids. I don’t shout. I never shout. Shouting is for people who have lost control, and control is the only currency I have left.

Kenji, my sous-chef—a man twenty years my senior who still plates like he’s shoveling gravel—flinches. He slides the plate onto the pass. I look at it. The broccoli is limp, a sad, soggy green that suggests it gave up on life long before it hit the boiling water. The sauce is congealing at the edges, a sugary, cornstarch-thickened glaze that Americans mistake for Cantonese cuisine.

It’s an insult to my ancestors. It’s also $18.95, and we need the money.

"Wipe the rim," I say, my hand already moving to do it for him. My thumb, wrapped in a towel, swipes away a stray drop of brown sauce. "And next time, blanch the broccoli for thirty seconds less. It’s a vegetable, Kenji, not a sponge."

He grunts, turning back to the fryer. The kitchen is a symphony of violence—the hiss of oil meeting water, the *clack-clack-clack* of metal ladles hitting wok steel, the shout of orders. The air is thick enough to chew, tasting of scorched scallions and old grease. I love it. I hate it. It’s the only place the noise in my head stops.

I check the ticket rail. Friday night dinner rush. The printer chatters, spitting out another order. Sweet and Sour Pork. Kung Pao Chicken (mild). Fortune cookies.

We are bleeding out. I know the books better than I know my own reflection. I know we switched to lower-grade shrimp three weeks ago. I know the oil in the fryer is a day past its prime. I know that if we don’t make rent this month, the landlord won’t just evict us; the Dragon Head Society will send someone to explain the economics of failure with a crowbar.

"Mei-Lin!"

The voice is breathless, high-pitched, and sweet—like sugar spun too thin. Ruby.

My sister bursts through the swinging doors, bringing a gust of air-conditioned dining room air with her. She’s flushed, her lipstick perfect, her silk dress clinging in all the right places. She looks like the princess of Chinatown. I look like the maid who scrubs the grout.

"There’s a man at table seven," she whispers, clutching a menu like a shield. "He says the tea is cold and he’s... he’s grabbing my wrist when I try to pour it."

My spine stiffens. The exhaustion evaporates, replaced by a cold, familiar burn in my gut.

"Stay here," I order. "Watch the pass. Don’t touch anything hot."

I push through the doors. The transition is jarring—from the violent, honest heat of the kitchen to the muffled, velvet-draped purgatory of the dining room. It smells of dust and jasmine tea. Gold dragons climb the red wallpaper, their eyes peeling slightly.

Table seven. A tourist. Beefy neck, face flushed with cheap sake, wearing a polo shirt that’s losing the battle against his gut.

I approach the table. I don’t smile. I am not the host. I am the wall he is about to hit.

"Is there a problem with the service, sir?"

He looks up, blinking. He was expecting Ruby—soft, pliable Ruby. Instead, he gets me. My hair is pulled back so tight it pulls the corners of my eyes taut. My chef’s coat is buttoned to the chin, stained with the ghost of soy sauce. I am holding a clipboard like a weapon.

"Tea’s cold," he slurs. "And the little waitress is rude."

"The tea is fresh," I say, my voice flat. "And the waitress is my sister. If you touch her again, you will leave. If you don’t leave, I will have the kitchen porters remove you. They handle garbage for a living; they won’t mind one more bag."

The table goes silent. His wife looks at her plate. The man’s face turns a darker shade of mottled red. For a second, I see the violence in his eyes—the urge to put the uppity woman in her place.

*Do it,* I think. *Give me a reason.*

He breaks first. He grumbles, picks up his fork, and stabs a piece of pork.

"Check, please," his wife whispers.

I nod once, turn on my heel, and walk back to the kitchen. My hands are shaking. not from fear. From the adrenaline of almost letting the monster out. I want to scream. I want to shatter every porcelain plate in this restaurant.

Instead, I walk back through the swinging doors.

"Order up," I say.

#### * * *

The silence of a kitchen after closing is the loudest sound in the world.

The porters have mopped the floors, leaving the red quarry tiles slick and smelling of bleach and old grease. The woks are cold, scrubbed down to dull grey metal. The hum of the refrigerator compressor is a steady, rhythmic throb, like a dying heartbeat.

Ruby went home an hour ago, complaining of sore feet. I sent her a cab. I stayed.

I always stay.

I stand at the prep station, the only light coming from the heat lamp above me. This is my time. The "Staff Meal." It’s a joke, really, because I’m the only staff left.

I’m not cooking from the menu. The menu is a lie. The menu is corn syrup and red dye number four.

I pull a handful of fresh wheat noodles from under a damp cloth. In a small pot, I have a broth that has been simmering for six hours—pork bone, star anise, dried tangerine peel, and a handful of Sichuan peppercorns that numb the tongue before the heat hits. It’s dark, complex, and violent.

I drop the noodles. *One, two, three.*

I lift them out with chopsticks, the steam curling around my face, opening my pores. I ladle the broth over them. I top it with pickled mustard greens and a spoonful of chili oil that glows a radioactive red.

It smells like memory. It smells like the kitchen before my father got sick, before the debts, before I had to become the accountant, the manager, the bouncer, and the martyr.

I lean against the stainless steel counter, bowl in hand, and close my eyes. I lift the spoon.

"That smells like tear gas and heaven."

The voice comes from the shadows near the delivery entrance. It’s smooth, baritone, and entirely out of place.

I don’t jump. I don’t spill a drop. I freeze, my survival instincts locking my muscles into place. I open my eyes and turn, slowly.

Jason Tang is standing in my kitchen.

He shouldn't be here. He belongs in the Financial District, in glass towers and boardrooms. He’s wearing a suit that costs more than my car—midnight blue, tailored to suggest the lean, dangerous muscle beneath without advertising it. No tie. The top button of his white shirt is undone, exposing a throat that looks carved from marble.

He’s beautiful. It’s an irritating, objective fact, like gravity. High cheekbones, eyes that tilt up at the corners with a sharpness that suggests he misses nothing, and a mouth that looks cruel even when it’s relaxed.

"We’re closed," I say. My voice is steady, but my pulse is hammering against the collar of my chef’s coat.

He steps into the light. The contrast is visceral—his polished leather shoes on my greasy floor, his clean lines against the battered, dented steel of the prep table. He looks like a panther stalking through a landfill.

" I didn't see a lock on the back door," he says. He moves with a fluid, predatory grace, walking toward me. He doesn't ask permission. He just takes the space.

"Because the lock is broken," I snap. "Like everything else in this building. Which you would know if you checked your maintenance requests instead of breaking and entering."

Jason Tang stops three feet away from me. Close enough that I can smell him. He doesn't smell like the kitchen. He smells of ozone, expensive scotch, and the cold, damp air of the Bay.

"I’m not the landlord, Mei-Lin."

"You own the building. You own the block. You own the debt." I tighten my grip on the ceramic bowl, the heat radiating into my palms. "You’re the landlord. You’re just the one with the Triad pedigree."

His eyes darken, just a fraction. A flicker of something sharp behind the smooth facade. I shouldn't have said it. You don't mention the Dragon Head Society to the Dragon Head. Not if you want to keep your kneecaps.

But I am so tired. I am so tired of being polite to men who hold the leash.

"I'm here to collect," he says softly.

"The payment isn't due until the first."

"I'm not here for the envelope." He looks at the bowl in my hands. He inhales, his nostrils flaring slightly. "I'm here for dinner."

"I told you. We're closed. The fryers are off."

"I don't want the garbage you serve the tourists," he says. He steps closer. He is inside my guard now. I should step back, but the counter is digging into my hips. I have nowhere to go. "I want that."

He nods at the bowl.

"This is my dinner," I say.

"Share."

It’s a command, not a request. He reaches out. For a second, I think he’s going to touch me, and my skin prickles, a hot flush crawling up my neck like an accusation. But he just reaches past me, his arm brushing my shoulder—a shock of heat through the cotton—and picks up a spoon from the drying rack.

He dips the spoon into my bowl.

I am paralyzed. It is such a flagrant violation of boundaries. He is eating from my bowl, standing in my sanctuary, breathing my air.

He lifts the spoon to his lips. I watch his throat work as he swallows. It’s intimate. Too intimate. It feels like he just licked my thumb.

He pauses. He closes his eyes. For a long moment, he says nothing. The silence stretches, tight as a piano wire.

Then he opens his eyes and looks at me. Really looks at me. Not at the manager, not at the frantic woman holding the line, but at *me*.

"The menu out there," he gestures vaguely toward the dining room, "is a crime scene. It’s dead. It’s performative nostalgia for people who think Panda Express is ethnic food."

My knuckles turn white around the bowl. "Get out."

He ignores me. He takes another spoonful. "But this... this is alive. Star anise. Dried scallop? And the heat... it’s not just chili. It’s anger. It’s frustration." He looks at me, his dark eyes glittery and unreadable. "It tastes like you want to burn the place down."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Liar."

He sets the spoon down on the counter with a soft *clink*. He leans in, placing one hand on the steel on either side of me, boxing me in. He is so tall. I have to tilt my head back to meet his gaze. The air between us is suddenly charged, heavy with static.

"The Golden Phoenix is dying, Mei-Lin. You’re drowning in debt. You’re buying grade-C shrimp and hoping no one notices. You’re paying protection money to my father’s lieutenants for a protection you don’t need because the only thing threatening this place is its own mediocrity."

Every word is a slap. Every word is true.

"If you’re here to evict us," I whisper, my voice trembling with rage, "just do it. Spare me the restaurant review."

"I don't want to evict you," he says. His voice drops, turning low and rough, dragging across my skin like velvet over a fresh bruise. "I want the real estate. I want to tear this building down and put up glass and steel. I want to erase the past."

"Then do it."

"I can't. Not yet." He looks at the bowl again, then back to my mouth. His gaze lingers there, heavy and speculative. "Not when you can cook like this."

He pushes off the counter, the sudden absence of his body heat leaving me shivering. He adjusts his cuffs, the mask of the CEO sliding back into place.

"I don't want your money, Mei-Lin. I don't want the envelope on the first. I want a partnership."

"A partnership," I repeat, the word tasting like ash. "With the Triad."

"With me," he corrects. "I'm going to rebrand this place. I'm going to gut the front of house. No more gold dragons. No more fortune cookies. We serve this." He points to the noodles. "We serve the food you eat in the dark."

"And what do you get out of it?"

"Legitimacy," he says. "And... something worth eating."

He turns to the door. He pauses with his hand on the frame, looking back over his shoulder. The fluorescent light catches the sharp angle of his jaw.

"Think about it. Or don't. But if you serve that sweet and sour pork one more night, you're killing your soul, and I won't have to evict you. You'll be dead already."

He walks out into the alley. The door swings shut, cutting off the swirl of fog outside.

I am alone in the kitchen. The smell of his cologne—expensive, dark, masculine—lingers in the air, overpowering the garlic.

I look down at my bowl. The noodles are getting cold.

I lift the spoon—the one he used—and bring it to my mouth. I taste the broth. It’s spicy, numbing, perfect. And underneath the heat, I can taste the ghost of him.

My hand shakes, the spoon rattling against my teeth.

I hate him. I hate his suit, his arrogance, his truth. I hate that he saw through the cracks I’ve spent five years plastering over.

But as I swallow the soup, feeling the burn slide down my throat, I realize the terrifying truth.

He’s right. I do want to burn it all down. And for the first time in my life, someone just handed me a match.
