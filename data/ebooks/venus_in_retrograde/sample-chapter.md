Sixty-eight degrees.

The thermostat at Celestia Dynamics is set to the precise thermal sweet spot where the human brain achieves peak cognitive efficiency while simultaneously ensuring nipples remain visible through anything less than dual-ply cashmere. It is a calculated aggression, like everything else in this building.

I walk down the corridor of the West Wing, my heels striking the polished concrete floor with a rhythm that sounds like a countdown. *Click-clack. Click-clack.* Staccato warnings. The sound is sharp enough to slice through the low-frequency hum of the server stacks that vibrates in the walls, a constant, electric heartbeat that most people stop hearing after their first week. I never stop hearing it. It reminds me where I am. It reminds me that while I am soft tissue and anxiety wrapped in silk, the building is hard logic and unyielding memory.

My phone buzzes against my palm—a frantic, insectile vibration. I don't look down. I know who it is. It’s the Crisis Management team, a misnomer if there ever was one, considering they couldn't manage a ham sandwich without a Gantt chart.

*Breathe in.* The air tastes like recycled ozone and expensive ambition.
*Breathe out.* Push the panic down into the little black box in my stomach where I keep my mother, my imposter syndrome, and my fear of poverty.

I lift the phone, my thumb hovering over the glass. The email preview is a wall of text from a junior VP panicking about a "data scraping anomaly" that some tech blog picked up. They’re using words like *breach* and *catastrophe*.

I stop walking. I align the toe of my left pump with the seam of the floor tile. Perfect alignment. Control.

*It’s not a breach, you idiots. It’s a feature.*

I type the reply one-handed, my thumb flying. *The data aggregation is within the Terms of Service. Section 4, paragraph C. Do not apologize. Do not clarify. Silence is confidence. If you issue a press release, you validate the accusation. Pivot to the Q3 user growth metrics. Send.*

I slide the phone into my blazer pocket. The fabric is structured, severe. I wear glasses I don’t actually need—frames with zero-magnification lenses that cost four hundred dollars. They act as a windshield, a barrier between my eyes and the people who want things from me. When I push them up the bridge of my nose, it signals intellect. When I take them off and clean them, it signals that I am disappointed in your lack of foresight.

I am Jennifer Vane. I am the weather vane. I point whichever way the wind needs to blow to keep this ship sailing, and right now, the wind is blowing cold.

I step into the elevator, the doors sliding shut with a pneumatic *hiss* that seals me in a stainless steel coffin. I catch my reflection in the brushed metal. My lipstick is a shade called "Power Red," applied with the precision of a sniper. My hair is pulled back so tight it pulls my eyes slightly upward, giving me a look of permanent, skeptical alertness.

I look like a woman who has never overdrawn a checking account. I look like a woman who doesn't know what it feels like to wait for the landlord’s knock.

*Liar.*

The elevator drops. My stomach lurches, a momentary sensation of freefall that makes my thighs clench. I hate gravity. It’s the one law I can’t spin.

#### * * *

The Server Annex is the belly of the beast.

Most of the marketing team treats the basement levels like they’re radioactive. They stay up in the clouds, on the fortieth floor with the sunlight and the succulents and the kombucha taps. But I need a signature on the hardware allocation specs for the upcoming launch, and the Lead Systems Architect doesn't answer emails. He doesn't answer Slack. He is a black hole where communication goes to die.

The air is colder down here. It bites through my blazer, prickling the skin of my arms. The lighting is different, too—less of that flattering, diffuse corporate glow, and more of a harsh, clinical blue-white that casts no shadows and forgives no flaws.

I swipe my badge. The reader chirps—a cheerful, robotic bird—and the heavy magnetic lock disengages with a *thunk* that vibrates in my molars.

I push inside.

The noise hits me first. It’s not a hum down here; it’s a roar. A deafening, white-noise waterfall of cooling fans and spinning drives. It’s the sound of a billion secrets being shuffled and sorted. The room is a cathedral of data, rows of black monoliths stretching back into the gloom, blinking with rhythmic green and amber LEDs.

And there he is.

Gordon Kincaid.

He’s standing halfway down the third aisle, his back to me. He’s not wearing the company uniform of Patagonia vests and pleated khakis. He’s wearing a charcoal hoodie that looks soft, worn in the elbows, the hood gathered around his neck like a cowl. Jeans that actually fit his legs, dark denim scuffed at the hems.

He’s huge. That’s my first, unbidden thought, a thought that bypasses my frontal cortex and goes straight to the lizard brain. He takes up space. He displaces the air. The server rack he’s working on is seven feet tall, and he doesn't look small next to it.

"Mr. Kincaid," I say. My voice is pitched to cut through the fan noise, projected from the diaphragm. The voice of authority.

He doesn't turn. He doesn't flinch. He has a bundle of multicolored cables in one hand, his fingers moving with a dexterity that seems at odds with the sheer size of his hands.

I walk closer. The heels. *Click-clack.* He has to hear me.

"I sent you the allocation specs three times," I say, stopping five feet from his back. I can smell him from here. In a world of sanitized antiseptic and stale coffee, he smells like... earth. Like sandalwood and something darker, metallic, like rain on hot pavement. It’s a jarringly organic scent in this sterile tomb. "I need a sign-off, or the Q4 rollout slides."

Gordon Kincaid turns slowly.

It’s not a spin. It’s a rotation, deliberate and heavy, like a turret acquiring a target.

He looks at me, and for a second, the noise of the room seems to drop away, sucked into the vacuum of his stare. His eyes are dark, almost black, set deep under a heavy brow. He hasn't shaved in a few days—not the curated stubble of the sales team, but actual neglect. He looks tired. But it’s not the frazzled, caffeine-jittery exhaustion of the executives upstairs. It’s the deep, ancient fatigue of a man holding up a collapsing roof.

He doesn't look at my badge. He doesn't look at the tablet in my hand. He looks at my face. He looks right through the four-hundred-dollar non-prescription lenses.

"You're Vane," he says. His voice is a tectonic rumble, low enough that I feel it in the soles of my feet. It’s a voice that doesn't ask questions.

"Jennifer," I correct automatically, lifting my chin. "And you're the bottleneck."

He blinks, a slow, languid movement. He turns back to the rack, dismissing me entirely. "I'm not a bottleneck. I'm the filter. There's a difference."

He reaches up to a high shelf on the rack. As he does, the sleeves of his hoodie ride up.

I freeze.

His forearms are thick, corded with muscle that shifts under the skin as he grips a heavy drive enclosure. Dark hair dusts the skin, tapering down to wrists that look like they could snap a two-by-four. There’s a scar running down the inside of his left arm, jagged and white against the tan skin.

My mouth goes dry. Not thirsty-dry. *Wanting*-dry.

It’s an immediate, visceral betrayal of my own body. My pulse spikes, a hard *thump-thump* against the collar of my blouse. I stare at the flex of his brachioradialis as he twists a locking screw. It’s mesmerizing. It’s raw mechanics—leverage, torque, power.

I am a creature of the mind. I live in spreadsheets, in spin, in the abstract manipulation of perception. Gordon Kincaid is a creature of matter. He is solid. He is *heavy*.

"The specs," I say, but my voice lacks the snap it had a moment ago. It sounds thinner. Breathier. I hate it.

"The specs are wrong," he says to the machine. He slides the drive into a slot with a definitive *click*. "Marketing wants to allocate thirty percent of the processing core to user interface prediction. It's wasteful."

He turns back to me, wiping his hands on his jeans. The movement draws my eye to his hips. Narrower than his shoulders. Sturdy.

"Wasteful is a subjective term," I argue, clutching my tablet like a shield. "The user experience needs to be seamless. If the predictive text lags, we lose engagement."

Gordon takes a step toward me. Just one. But it obliterates my personal space bubble. He towers over me, forcing me to tilt my head back. Up close, his eyes aren't just black; they’re a dark, bruised purple, intense and unblinking.

"You don't care about engagement," he says softly. "You care about addiction. You want the machine to finish their sentences so they forget how to think for themselves."

The accusation hangs in the cold air. It’s true, of course. That is exactly what we do. But no one says it. We say *optimization*. We say *fluidity*. We don't say *lobotomy*.

"I care about the stock price," I lie. "And right now, you're threatening it."

He looks down at me, his gaze dropping to my mouth, then back to my eyes. It’s a violation. He’s reading the micro-expressions I’ve spent a decade learning to suppress. He sees the pulse in my neck. He sees the way my fingers are whitening around the edge of the tablet.

"You're cold," he observes.

"I'm fine."

"You're shivering." He says it like a data point. An irrefutable fact. "The ambient temperature is sixty-four down here. Your cortisol levels are keeping your core temp up, but your extremities are losing heat."

"Are you analyzing my biology or are you going to sign the form?" I snap, stepping back. The retreat feels like a defeat.

He holds out a hand. "Give it here."

I hand him the tablet. Our fingers brush.

*Static.*

A literal spark jumps between us, a blue snap of electricity born from the dry air and the synthetic carpet. I jerk my hand back. He doesn't flinch. He just takes the device, his fingers warm and rough against the sleek glass. He taps the screen once, signs with a jagged, illegible scrawl, and hands it back.

"Tell your team to re-route the load balancing," he says, turning away before I can even check the signature. "And wear a sweater, Vane. You look brittle."

I stand there for a full five seconds, staring at his broad back as he leans into the machine again. My skin is burning where the spark hit me. My heart is hammering a frantic, chaotic rhythm against my ribs.

*Brittle.*

I turn on my heel and walk out, forcing my hips to swing, forcing the *click-clack* of my shoes to sound authoritative. But my hands are shaking.

#### * * *

The boardroom is a glass fishbowl suspended over the atrium. It is designed to be transparent, to symbolize the company's commitment to openness, which is ironic since the glass is soundproof and bullet-resistant.

I am sitting in my usual seat, three down from the CEO’s right hand. The chair is an Aeron, ergonomic mesh designed to support the lumbar spine during twelve-hour interrogations.

The VP of Growth, a man named Chet who wears vests that are too tight and has teeth that are too white, is presenting a slide deck.

"We're looking at a vertical integration strategy," Chet says, pointing a laser at a graph that goes up and to the right. "If we can penetrate the lifestyle sector, our retention metrics will stabilize."

*Penetrate.*

The word lands in my lap like a stone.

I shift in my chair. The mesh rubs against the back of my thighs.

I shouldn't be thinking about it. I have a notepad in front of me. I have a pen. I should be taking notes on vertical integration. I should be formulating a question about the customer acquisition cost.

But my brain has been hijacked.

I look at the glass wall of the conference room. Through the reflection, I can see the ghost of my own face—composed, attentive, blank. But superimposed over it, I see *him*.

I see the server room. The darkness. The blue light.

I close my eyes for a blink that lasts too long.

*The fantasy blooms instantly, violent and vivid.*

In my mind, the boardroom door opens. Not the polite *whoosh* of the pneumatic seal, but a slam. Gordon walks in. He’s not wearing a suit. He’s wearing that hoodie, grease on his hands, the smell of ozone clinging to him like cologne.

The board members turn, shocked. Chet stops mid-sentence, his laser pointer wavering.

Gordon doesn't look at them. He looks at me.

He crosses the room in three strides. He doesn't speak. He grabs the back of my ergonomic chair and spins me around.

*Stand up.*

It’s not a request.

In the fantasy, I stand. My legs are weak. He grips my waist—his hands are so big they span the curve of my hips, his thumbs digging into the soft flesh beneath my blazer. He backs me up. He backs me right up against the floor-to-ceiling glass wall.

The city of Palo Alto is spread out below us, a grid of expensive logic. The board is watching. The CEO is watching.

Gordon doesn't care.

He pins my wrists above my head with one hand. Easy. Effortless. Like I am made of paper. His other hand goes to my throat, not choking, just holding. grounding. His thumb strokes the racing pulse in my carotid.

*You look brittle,* he growls in my ear. *Let me break you.*

I feel the cold glass against my back, stealing the heat from my skin. I feel the wall of heat that is his body pressing against my front. The friction of denim against my suit trousers. The hardness of him.

He kisses me. It’s not a romance-novel kiss. It’s a data extraction. He devours my mouth, biting my lower lip, his tongue sweeping through me, tasting the coffee and the lies. It’s messy. It’s wet. It’s loud.

The board members are shouting, but the glass is soundproof. I can't hear them. I can only hear the blood rushing in my ears and the rough, wet sound of our mouths.

He releases my wrists and his hand slides down. Down over the silk blouse. Down over the waistband of my trousers. He doesn't fumble with buttons. He rips. The sound of popping fabric is a gunshot in the silence.

My head falls back against the glass. I am exposed. I am ruined. I am open.

His hand is rough, calloused from twisting steel and pulling cable. He slides it inside my underwear. The shock of his skin against my wet heat makes my hips buck forward, seeking him, desperate for the friction. He finds the bundle of nerves that controls me—my own personal server rack—and he begins to work.

Rhythmic. Relentless. Mathematical precision applied to biological chaos.

*Look at them,* he whispers against my neck, his teeth scraping the sensitive skin under my ear. *Look at them watching you. They think you’re in control. They have no idea.*

He pushes two fingers inside me. I gasp, a broken, shattered sound. I am so wet I’m dripping down my thighs. I am flooding the system.

I grind back against his hand, abandoning all dignity. I want him to take me right here. I want him to lift me up and impale me against the glass while the stock price scrolls on the ticker behind his head. I want to be obliterated. I want to be...

"Jennifer?"

The voice is sharp. A needle popping a balloon.

My eyes snap open.

The boardroom is silent. There is no Gordon. There is no ripped blouse. My hands are clenched into fists on the mahogany table, knuckles white.

Chet is looking at me. The CEO is looking at me. Every head at the table is turned in my direction.

"I'm sorry?" I say. My voice is a wreck. It’s an octave too low, thick with phantom saliva. I clear my throat, flushing hot. The heat starts at my chest and crawls up my neck, a visible crimson brand of shame.

"I asked for your thoughts on the projection," Chet says, his eyebrows raised. He looks at me like I’m a malfunctioning printer. "Do you think the market can handle this level of... saturation?"

*Saturation.*

Oh god.

I shift in my seat. I am damp. Physically, undeniably damp. The seam of my trousers is cutting into me, a reminder of the ache that is throbbing between my legs like a second heartbeat.

"I..." I start. My brain is empty. The white noise of the server room is still roaring in my ears. I can still feel the phantom weight of Gordon’s hand on my throat.

"The growth," I stammer. I never stammer. "The... uh... the projection."

I look down at my notepad. I have written the word *HARD* three times in the margins. I flip the page over, my hand trembling.

"The projection is optimistic," I say, forcing the words out through a throat that feels tight. "But we need to be careful about... overexposure."

The CEO nods, satisfied. He turns back to Chet. "She's right. Let's keep the beta test closed for now."

They look away. The spotlight moves on.

I let out a breath that shudders in my lungs. I slide my hand under the table and dig my fingernails into my palm until the sharp bite of pain grounds me.

*Get it together, Vane.*

I look at my reflection in the glass table. My face is flushed. My pupils are blown wide, swallowing the iris. I look like a woman who has just been thoroughly, devastatingly fucked.

And the terrifying thing is, I haven't been touched.

I check my watch. It’s 2:00 PM.

I have four more hours of meetings. Four more hours of sitting in this chair, swimming in my own arousal, terrified that if I stand up, everyone will smell the musk of desire radiating off me like a pheromone bomb.

I look at the glass wall again.

Somewhere down in the basement, amidst the roar of the fans and the blue dark, Gordon Kincaid is rewriting the code. And up here, perfectly preserved in the sixty-eight-degree air, my operating system is crashing.

I pick up my pen.

*System Failure,* I write.

Then I cross it out.

*System Reboot.*

I uncross my legs, and the sensation sends a fresh jolt of electricity straight up my spine.

I’m in trouble.
