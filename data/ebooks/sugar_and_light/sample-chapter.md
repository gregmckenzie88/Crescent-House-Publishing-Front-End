The air conditioning in the Mercedes is set to sixty-eight degrees, but I can still feel Miami breathing against the glass. It’s a humid, desperate animal of a city, always trying to lick the sweat off your neck. I keep the windows up. I prefer my atmosphere controlled, filtered, and paid for.

The iron gates of Villa Sombra loom like a threat, twice the height of my sedan. I lower the window two inches—just enough to slide my ID card to the security guard. The air that rushes in smells of brine and exhaust, a reminder of the chaotic organic world I’m leaving behind.

"Valentina Reyes," the guard reads. He takes too long looking at the photo, then at me. He’s looking for the girl in the picture—soft lighting, hopeful smile—and finding the woman in the car. Hair pulled back so tight it pulls at my temples, a blazer sharp enough to cut paper, lips painted a defensive shade of crimson.

"Open it," I say. Not a request.

He blinks, the spell of his slow appraisal broken by my tone. The gates groan inward.

I drive up the long crushed-shell driveway, the tires crunching like bones snapping underfoot. The Castillo estate isn't a home; it's a mausoleum for the living. Art Deco geometry rises from the manicured jungle, all white stone and sharp angles, defying the soft, rot-prone nature of the tropics. It looks expensive, imperative, and utterly joyless.

Perfect.

I park next to a fountain where a stone cherub pisses eternally into a algae-free basin. Before I step out, I check my reflection in the rearview mirror. No shine on the nose. No stray hairs. I am not a person today; I am a technician. I am the surgeon here to fix the family heart.

The front doors are opened by a house manager who looks like he was vacuum-sealed into his suit. He introduces himself as Mr. Vance. He has the personality of a dial tone.

"Mr. Castillo is expecting you in the library," he says, turning on a heel.

I follow him into the belly of the beast.

The temperature drops ten degrees the moment the door clicks shut behind me. Villa Sombra is hermetically sealed. The air here doesn't move; it hovers. It smells of lemon oil, floor wax, and the distinct, metallic tang of money that has been sitting still for too long. My heels click-clack on the marble checkerboard floor, a metronome counting down the seconds until I can get my check and leave.

We pass rooms filled with furniture that looks like it’s never been sat on—couches wearing dust covers like shrouds, tables gleaming with a predatory shine. I hate houses like this. They aren't for living; they are for hoarding. They are museums without the public access, shrines to ego.

"You'll have full access to the solarium," Vance says over his shoulder. "It has been converted to your specifications."

"And the humidity controls?"

"Installed yesterday. Maintained at forty-five percent relative humidity, plus or minus two percent."

"Good."

I don't thank him. Gratitude implies a favor; this is a transaction. I am the best conservator in the Southeast. They aren't paying for my manners; they're paying for my silence and my scalpel.

Vance stops before a set of double mahogany doors that look heavy enough to withstand a siege. He knocks once, a sharp rap, then opens them.

"Ms. Reyes, sir."

The library is a cavern of dark wood and darker secrets. The curtains are drawn, strangling the daylight, leaving the room illuminated by the golden pools of vintage bankers' lamps. The smell here is richer—leather bindings, unsmoked tobacco, and the dry, sweet scent of old paper.

Silvio Castillo sits behind a desk that could serve as a landing strip. He is a small man, shrunken by age, but his eyes are black beads, unblinking and wet. He watches me enter with the stillness of a reptile waiting for a fly.

"Ms. Reyes," he says. His voice is a dry rustle, like dead leaves dragging on pavement. "You are younger than your reputation suggests."

"And you are richer," I reply, stopping in front of the desk. I don't sit. "We both have our surprises."

A dry chuckle escapes him. It sounds painful. "Efficient. I like that. I don't pay for pleasantries."

"Then show me the patient."

Silvio gestures a skeletal hand toward an easel draped in black velvet standing in the corner. "Legacy is a fragile thing, Ms. Reyes. It requires... maintenance."

I walk over to the easel. My heart does a traitorous little kick—the only emotion I allow myself. The anticipation of the reveal. It’s the only time I feel like an artist anymore, that split second before the artwork is exposed, when anything is possible.

I grip the velvet and pull.

*The Weeping Saint*.

It’s smaller than I expected, maybe twenty-four by thirty inches, but it holds the room hostage. The composition is striking—a martyr in ecstasy, head thrown back, tears catching the light like diamonds, the background a swallowing abyss of shadow. It’s beautiful in a heavy, suffocating way.

"It needs to be ready for the Foundation Gala in three weeks," Silvio says, his voice dropping an octave. "It has been in the vault for decades. It is the crown jewel of the Castillo collection. I want it vibrant. I want it to look as it did the day it was painted."

I lean in, not touching, just looking. My eyes shift into diagnostic mode. I stop seeing a saint; I see craquelure patterns, varnish discoloration, and pigment adhesion.

"The varnish has yellowed significantly," I murmur, more to myself than him. "Oxidation of the natural resin. There’s surface grime. Possible cleavage in the lower quadrant."

"Can you fix it?"

I turn to face him. "I don't *fix* art, Mr. Castillo. I stabilize it. I reveal what’s still there. If you want it to look new, hire a painter. If you want it to look true, you hire me."

He stares at me, his fingers drumming a slow rhythm on the leather desktop. "I was told you were difficult. I see they were right."

"I'm expensive," I correct. "Difficulty is a value-added service."

He smiles then, a stretching of thin skin that doesn't reach those shark-dead eyes. "Do your work, Ms. Reyes. But understand this: discretion is paramount. This house... it holds onto its history tightly. What you see here, what you hear here—it stays within these walls. The Castillos do not air their laundry."

"I'm not a laundress," I say, smoothing the lapel of my blazer. "I'm a conservator. My interest is in the canvas, not the family."

"See that it stays that way."

He dismisses me with a wave of his hand, turning his attention back to the papers on his desk. I feel a prickle of unease crawl up my spine—a cold, oily sensation. There is a weight to his gaze, a possessiveness that makes me want to shower.

I turn on my heel and walk out, letting the heavy doors thud shut behind me. I take a breath, tasting the filtered air.

Step one: Secure the perimeter.
Step two: Analyze the damage.
Step three: Don't let the monsters bite.

The solarium is the only room in the house that feels alive, mostly because it’s the only one trying to kill me with brightness.

Vance wasn't lying about the setup. It’s spectacular. Floor-to-ceiling glass looking out over the bay, fitted with UV-filtering shades that diffuse the brutal Miami sun into a soft, milky glow. My equipment is already arranged on the steel worktables—microscopes, solvent traps, fume extractors. The smell of the room is clean, sharp—my brand of sterile.

I’ve spent the last hour unboxing my tools, arranging my scalpels and swabs in a precise grid. Control. It calms the static in my head.

*The Weeping Saint* sits on the main easel, stripped of its frame. Under the harsh scrutiny of my magnifying lamp, the painting looks less holy and more tired. The varnish is a sickly amber cataracts over the saint's eyes.

I pull on a pair of blue nitrile gloves, the snap of the latex against my wrist a familiar comfort. I pick up a cotton swab and dip it into a mild solvent mixture—isooctane and ethanol. Just a test. A tiny window into the truth.

I’m about to touch the corner of the canvas when the glass door to the garden crashes open.

The noise shatters my focus like a dropped mirror. My hand jerks, hovering inches from the paint.

"Jesus Christ," I hiss, spinning around.

A man stumbles in from the terrace. He brings the heat with him—a blast of humid, heavy air that instantly wars with the AC. He looks like he’s just survived a shipwreck, or a very expensive party.

He’s wearing a white linen suit that is criminally wrinkled, the top three buttons of his shirt undone to reveal a expanse of tan skin and a sheen of sweat. He’s barefoot. He’s holding a tumbler of amber liquid that definitely isn't iced tea.

"You," he says, pointing the glass at me. His voice is a lazy drawl, thick with sleep and something harder. "You're the dust buster."

I stare at him. He is objectively beautiful, in the way a natural disaster is beautiful. Dark curls riot over his forehead, his jaw is shadowed with stubble, and his mouth is loose, arrogant, and currently curved into a smirk that makes me want to staple it shut.

"And you are contaminating my clean room," I say, my voice clipped. "Close the door."

He blinks, looking at the door as if he’s never seen one before, then kicks it shut with a heel. He doesn't apologize. He saunters toward my worktable, bringing a cloud of sensory assault with him—stale whiskey, expensive sandalwood, and the musk of a man who hasn't showered off last night's sins.

"Grandfather said he hired a nun," he says, leaning his hip against the table, dangerously close to my solvents. He looks me up and down, his gaze tactile, heavy. It drags over my suit, my pulled-back hair, my gloves. "You look the part. Very... buttoned up."

"Get off the table," I say.

He ignores me, tilting his head to look at the painting. "Ah. The crying guy. Gloomy, isn't it? The old man loves his guilt."

"Who are you?" I ask, though I already know. The entitlement radiates off him like radiation.

"Diego," he says, taking a sip of his drink. He winces, as if the alcohol hurts, then smiles anyway. It’s a bright, blinding thing, that smile. It lights up the darker corners of the room. "Diego Castillo. The disappointment of the family. And you are?"

"Busy."

He laughs, a low, rough sound that vibrates in his chest. I can see the movement of his throat as he swallows, the strong column of his neck. My eyes catch on the veins in his forearm, raised and roped under the skin as he grips the glass.

*Stop it.*

"Busy," he repeats. "Doing what? Watching paint dry?"

"Removing sixty years of neglect so your family can pretend they care about culture for one night," I snap. "Please step back. You're vibrating."

"Am I?" He leans closer. He’s too close. I can see the gold flecks in his dark eyes, the bloodshot rim of exhaustion. "Maybe you're just stiff, *cariño*."

The endearment lands like a slap. *Cariño*. Sweetheart. It’s cheap, lazy charm, the kind men like him use to disarm waitresses and hostesses.

"Don't call me that," I say, stepping into his space rather than retreating. I am the authority here. "And don't breathe on the art. The ethanol on your breath is likely to dissolve the varnish."

He freezes. His eyes widen slightly, surprised by the bite. Then, the smirk deepens.

"Ethanol," he murmurs, testing the word. "You're funny. I like you."

"I'm not here to be liked. I'm here to work." I point a gloved finger at the door. "Go sleep it off, Diego. Come back when you can walk in a straight line."

He pushes off the table, swaying slightly. He raises his glass in a mock toast. "Aye, aye, Captain. Try not to have too much fun without me. It’s quiet in this house. You might start hearing the ghosts."

He turns and walks toward the interior door, his movements loose and languid, a stark contrast to the rigid geometry of the room. I watch him go. I watch the way the linen trousers drape over his hips, the broad line of his shoulders.

I hate him instantly. I hate the ease with which he moves through the world, the careless waste of his privilege. I hate that he smells like danger and bad decisions.

But mostly, I hate that when he looked at me, for a fraction of a second, I wondered what he would look like under the harsh light of my magnifying lamp. I wondered if I could find the cracks in his varnish, too.

The door clicks shut. The silence rushes back in, heavy and suffocating.

I look down at my hands. The blue nitrile fingers are trembling, just barely. A micro-tremor.

I close my eyes, inhale the clean, chemical scent of turpentine, and force my heart to slow down.

*Focus, Valentina.*

I pick up the scalpel. I turn back to the saint.

It’s just paint. It’s just canvas. It’s just a job.

I tell myself this lie as I make the first incision into the past.
