The humidity hits me like a physical blow, a wet, heavy palm against my face that instantly ruins my blowout.

Chicago is two thousand miles and forty degrees away, safely tucked behind the glass wall of O'Hare where the air is sterile and recycled and smells like floor wax. Here, the air is a living thing. It smells of salt, of diesel exhaust, and something sweet and rotting—overripe mangoes fermenting in the gutters, maybe, or just the scent of the jungle encroaching on the pavement.

I drag my suitcase over the uneven gravel of the driveway, the plastic wheels chattering a frantic, staccato rhythm that echoes too loudly in the heavy afternoon silence. The handle is slick under my grip. I’ve been in Puerto Rico for less than three hours, and I am already dissolving. My silk blouse, a charcoal-gray armor I wear to signal *competence* and *authority*, is currently signaling that I am an idiot who doesn't know how to dress for the tropics. It clings to my lower back, a second skin of damp misery.

"Just relax," my therapist had said. "Go to the place your parents talked about. Reconnect. Unplug."

*Unplug.* The word sounds like a threat.

I wrestle the key from the lockbox, breaking a nail in the process. The jagged edge catches on the fabric of my slacks as I shove the door open. The rental casita is charming in the way online listings are charming—photogenic, rustic, and lacking central air conditioning. The ceiling fan spins lazily, chopping at the thick air without actually moving it.

I leave the luggage in the middle of the terracotta floor and immediately hunt for the Wi-Fi router.

My heart is doing that thing again—the flutter-thump against my ribs that feels like a trapped bird. It’s the silence. It’s too quiet here. No sirens, no L-train rumble, no constant hum of the server room down the hall. Just the aggressive buzz of insects and the distant, rhythmic crash of the ocean.

I find the router blinking cheerfully behind a ceramic rooster. I set up my laptop on the small dining table before I even unpack my toothbrush. The screen glows to life, a blue-light beacon of safety. I check my email. Nothing urgent. I check Slack. Quiet.

*I am not essential.*

The thought is a cold spike in my gut. I open a spreadsheet, just to look at the grid. The clean lines, the formulas, the conditional formatting. This is my language. This is where I make sense. Out there, past the mosquito netting, is an island I’m supposed to belong to by blood, but which feels as foreign to me as Mars. I speak the language like a textbook, I dress like a mainlander, and I sweat like a sinner in church.

I am a fraud in paradise.

I type a meaningless sentence into a blank document just to hear the click of the keys. *Deliverables for Q3.* I backspace. *Strategic alignment regarding...*

A bead of sweat rolls down the valley between my breasts, tracing a slow, itchy line to my waistband. I shudder. I need a shower. I need to wash off the plane, the airport, the impostor syndrome.

But first, I align the laptop perfectly with the edge of the table. I arrange my notebook and pen at a ninety-degree angle. I create a command center. If I have to be here, forced into this terrifying leisure, I will manage it like a project. I will optimize my relaxation. I will execute this vacation with ruthless efficiency.

#### * * *

The sound tears through my dreamless sleep like a chainsaw through bone.

It’s a high-pitched, oscillating shriek that vibrates in my teeth. I bolt upright, tangled in the thin sheet, my heart hammering a panic rhythm. For a second, I think it’s a fire alarm. Then the sound drops an octave, becoming a grinding, guttural roar, before pitching up again.

I check my phone. 6:45 AM.

"Are you kidding me?" I croak. My voice is rusted over from dehydration.

The noise stops. Silence rushes back in, filled only by the chirping of birds that sound deceptively cheerful. I fall back against the pillows, exhaling a breath I didn't know I was holding.

*ZZZZZZZZZZZZT.*

It’s back, louder this time. It sounds like dentistry on a giant.

I throw the sheet off. I have a conference call at eight—a check-in I technically isn't supposed to be on, but which I insisted on auditing just to "keep a finger on the pulse." I cannot act as a silent, omniscient observer if the background noise sounds like a construction site in hell.

I march to the window and shove the wooden slats open.

The property next door is separated from my rental by a chain-link fence woven with hibiscus, but the gaps are wide enough to see the source of my misery. It’s an open-air structure, a roof of corrugated tin held up by thick wooden posts. A workshop.

And in the center of it, a man is murdering the peace and quiet.

He has his back to me. He’s wearing faded jeans that hang dangerously low on his hips and heavy work boots. That’s it. No shirt. No safety gear other than headphones and a dust mask. He’s leaning over a long, pale shape on sawhorses—a surfboard, I realize—wielding a power sander with focused, brutal intensity.

Fine white dust coats his skin, turning him into a ghost. But underneath the dust, the muscles of his back shift and coil like snakes under a sheet. He moves with the machine, a fluid, rocking motion that runs from his shoulders down to his calves.

I don’t care if he has the body of a Greek statue dipped in flour; he is ruining my morning.

I grab my robe—silk, slippery, useless—and tie it tight around my waist. I shove my feet into slippers and storm out the back door. The humidity is already waiting for me, a wet dog jumping on my chest.

I march to the fence line. "Excuse me!"

The sander screams on. He doesn't hear me. He runs the machine along the rail of the board, his body curving over it possessively. There is something obscene about the motion, the way he handles the foam, smoothing it down, grinding away the imperfections.

"Hello!" I shout, gripping the chain-link. The metal is warm and rusty under my fingers. "Hola!"

He pauses. He lifts the sander, shuts it off, and the silence that follows is sudden and ringing. He doesn't turn around immediately. He runs a hand over the spot he just sanded, a long, sensual stroke that checks for smoothness. His hand is large, the fingers long and coated in white dust.

Then he turns.

He pulls the dust mask down around his neck. His face is all sharp angles and stubble, his hair pulled back in a messy bun that is escaping in dark, frizzy tendrils. He looks like he slept in a pile of sawdust and didn't mind.

He sees me, and his expression doesn't change. No polite smile. No neighborly wave. Just a flat, dark stare that makes me conscious of the fact that I am wearing a silk robe in the middle of a jungle.

"¿Qué?" he says. Not *what can I do for you*, not *good morning*. Just *what*.

I straighten my spine, summoning my boardroom voice. I switch to Spanish, the formal, Castilian-tinged Spanish I learned in university, not the rapid-fire Puerto Rican dialect my grandmother refused to teach me because she wanted us to be *American*.

"*Disculpe, señor. El ruido. Es muy temprano.*" Excuse me, sir. The noise. It is very early.

He stares at me for a beat longer, then pulls his headphones down. They rest around his neck, next to the dust mask. "It’s seven," he says. In English. His voice is deep, scratchy, like gravel tumbling in a dryer.

"It is six fifty-two," I correct him, switching to English because clearly, my accent has already betrayed me. "And people are trying to sleep."

"People are sleeping," he says, gesturing vaguely toward the house on the other side of him. "Tourists are complaining."

The word lands like a slap. *Tourist.*

"I am working," I snap. "I have a call at eight."

He leans back against the surfboard, crossing his arms. The white dust on his chest is streaked with sweat, creating little rivulets of dark, bronze skin. "You’re on vacation. Relax."

"I don't need relaxation advice from someone running industrial machinery at dawn." I can feel the flush creeping up my neck. It’s the heat, I tell myself. Just the heat. "Is there a noise ordinance here? Because I will check."

A corner of his mouth ticks up. It’s not a smile; it’s a smirk of disbelief. "You gonna call the cops because I’m working in my own shop? *En serio?*"

"If you don't stop, yes."

He laughs, a short, dry sound. He looks me up and down, his eyes lingering on the silk robe, the perfectly manicured toes in the slippers, the hair I haven't had time to tame. He is dissecting me, peeling back the layers of expensive fabric to find the soft, useless creature underneath.

"Go ahead, *gringa*," he says softly. "Call them. They might get here by Tuesday."

"My name is Carolina," I say, the name tasting stiff in my mouth. "And I am not a gringa."

He pushes off the surfboard. He walks toward the fence, closing the distance between us. He moves with a predatory grace, slow and heavy. He smells of cedar dust and fiberglass resin and old sweat. It’s a pungent, masculine smell that hits me in the back of the throat.

He stops a foot from the fence. Up close, his eyes are the color of strong coffee, dark and unreadable.

"Carolina," he repeats. He says it differently than I do. He rolls the *r*, softens the vowels. It sounds like a different name entirely. It sounds like something native to this soil. "You look like a Carolina from Chicago. Or maybe New York."

"Chicago," I admit, hating that he clocked me so easily.

"Go back inside, Carolina from Chicago," he says. "Put your earplugs in. Close your windows. Turn on your AC."

"I don't have AC."

He shrugs. The motion draws my eye to his clavicle, where a drop of sweat is pooling in the hollow of his throat. "Then sweat. It’s good for you."

He turns his back on me. He walks back to the sawhorses, pulls his mask up, and flips the switch on the sander.

*SCREEEEEEEEE.*

The noise hits me again, a physical vibration. I stand there for a moment, gripping the fence until my knuckles turn white. I want to scream. I want to throw a rock at his tin roof. I want to climb over this fence and unplug his machine.

But mostly, I am paralyzed by the sudden, humiliating realization that while I am furious, my body has gone traitorously, confusingly soft. My nipples are hard against the silk. There is a heavy, pooling heat in my belly that has nothing to do with the temperature.

I watch him for ten seconds too long. I watch the way his triceps bunch as he applies pressure to the board. I watch the sweat soak through the waistband of his jeans.

I hate him. I absolutely hate him.

I spin on my heel and march back to the house, slamming the door behind me. It doesn't help. The noise comes right through the wood.

I sit down at my table. I open my laptop. I try to read the Q3 projections. But the numbers are just black marks on a white screen. All I can see is that back, coated in dust, moving with a rhythm that feels like a taunt.

*Sweat,* he said. *It’s good for you.*

I wipe my forehead with the back of my hand. I am sweating. And I hate that he’s right.

#### * * *

By evening, the air has changed. It hasn't cooled down—if anything, it feels heavier, a wet wool blanket draped over the world—but the quality of the light has shifted. The sun dissolved into the ocean in a spectacular, violent bruise of purple and orange, and now the darkness is total.

There are no streetlights here. Just the moon, fat and yellow, and the distant, glowing pulse of the water down in the cove. Bioluminescence. I read about it. Dinoflagellates that light up when agitated.

*Agitated.* I can relate.

I am sitting on the patio in the dark, a glass of warm white wine in my hand because the fridge in the casita is barely colder than the room. I successfully missed my conference call. The Wi-Fi dropped out at 7:55 AM and didn't come back until noon. I spent four hours pacing the small room, refreshing the browser, feeling my blood pressure tick up with every "No Connection" error.

Now, I am exhausted. But not the good kind of exhausted—not the satisfying depletion that comes after a twelve-hour day of closing deals. This is a gritty, sticky exhaustion. My skin feels coated in a film of salt and bug spray.

I should be sleeping. But I’m watching him again.

The workshop next door is lit by a single, bare bulb hanging from a cord. It casts harsh, swinging shadows against the corrugated metal roof.

Joaquín—I heard the mailman call him that earlier—is cleaning up.

The violence of the morning is gone. Now, the mood is almost reverent. He’s sweeping. It sounds mundane, but the way he does it is hypnotic. He uses a wide push-broom, moving the piles of white dust into neat mounds. He moves slowly, methodically. *Swish. Step. Swish. Step.*

He’s still shirtless. The dust is gone from his skin, replaced by a sheen of fresh sweat and water—he must have hosed himself off at some point. His skin glows bronze under the yellow light.

I take a sip of the tepid wine. It tastes like vinegar and oak.

I should close the blinds. I’m a voyeur, sitting here in the dark, watching a man sweep his floor. It’s creepy. It’s pathetic.

But I can’t look away.

There is something about his solitude that calls to me. In Chicago, I am never alone. Even in my apartment, I am connected. My phone buzzes. My email pings. The city hums. Here, he is an island on an island. He seems completely self-contained. He doesn't need a signal. He doesn't need validation. He just needs his hands and his wood and his tools.

He stops sweeping. He leans the broom against a post and walks over to the surfboard he was shaping earlier. It’s resting on a rack now.

He runs his hand down the length of it.

I stop breathing.

The gesture is so tender it feels illicit. His palm glides over the curve of the rail, cupping the edge. He isn't checking for flaws anymore. He’s admiring the line. He’s greeting the thing he made.

My mind, treacherous and bored and overheated, supplies an image. I imagine those hands, rough and calloused and stained with resin, moving over my skin like that.

I imagine lying on that workbench. I imagine him checking me for imperfections.

*Too tense here,* his thumb would press into my shoulder. *Too hard here,* his palm would flatten against my stomach.

He would find all the sharp, jagged edges of me—the parts I’ve honed into weapons to survive the corporate ladder—and he would sand them down. He wouldn't be gentle. He would use that same relentless, grinding pressure he used on the board. He would hold me down until I stopped fighting, until I was smooth and yielding and stripped of all this useless armor.

A shiver runs through me, chasing the sweat down my spine. My nipples tighten, aching against the fabric of my tank top.

I bring the wine glass to my lips and drain it.

*Get a grip, Caro.*

He’s a rude, arrogant manual laborer who called you a tourist. He’s exactly the kind of man my mother warned me about—the ones who stay, who drown in the slow tide of the island, who have nothing to offer but calluses and empty pockets.

Joaquín reaches up and pulls the chain on the lightbulb.

The workshop plunges into darkness.

For a second, the afterimage of his torso burns behind my eyelids. Then, nothing. Just the chorus of the coquí frogs, screaming their existence into the night: *Co-quí, co-quí, co-quí.*

I sit in the dark for a long time, listening to the silence of the house next door. I wonder if he’s alone in there. I wonder if he has a woman—someone soft and local who knows how to cook rice without burning it, someone who doesn't wear silk robes in the jungle.

I stand up, my legs stiff. I rinse my glass in the sink. I check my phone one last time.

One new email from my boss. *Subject: Urgent - Compliance Issue.*

I stare at the subject line. Yesterday, this would have sent a jolt of adrenaline through my veins. I would have opened it immediately. I would have drafted a response. I would have fixed it.

Tonight, I look at the glowing screen, and all I can feel is the phantom pressure of a rough hand on the small of my back.

I close the laptop. I leave the email unread.

I crawl into the bed, under the mosquito net that hangs like a bridal veil, and lie there, listening to the ocean. It sounds like breathing. Heavy, rhythmic, inevitable.

I hate it here. I hate the heat. I hate the bugs. I hate the man next door.

I close my eyes, and the darkness feels like a waiting mouth. I have a terrible, sinking feeling that I am not going to get any work done on this trip. And worse, I have a feeling that the Carolina who goes back to Chicago might not be the same one who arrived.

Something is going to break here. I just hope it isn't me.
