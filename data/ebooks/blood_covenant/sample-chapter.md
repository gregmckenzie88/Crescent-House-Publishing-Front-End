The tourniquet snaps against my bicep, a rubber kiss that promises pain. I watch the vein in the crook of my left elbow rise—a blue river pushing against the pale dam of my skin. It pulses, impatient. Hungry.

*There you are,* I think, the thought sliding through my mind with the cold precision of a scalpel. *The monster in the marrow.*

The air in the clinic is scrubbed raw, smelling of isopropyl alcohol and the ozone hum of the HEPA filters. It’s a scent that usually calms me, the olfactory equivalent of a blank white page, but tonight it does nothing to settle the tremor in my hands.

I pick up the butterfly needle. My reflection warps in the stainless steel of the prep table—a ghost of a woman with dark circles carved under her eyes like bruises and lips pressed into a bloodless line. I look like a junkie preparing a fix. In a way, I am. But I’m not shooting up to get high; I’m shooting up to stay human.

I slide the needle in. The pinch is sharp, grounding. Dark red blooms in the tube, rushing toward the vacuum vial with terrifying enthusiasm.

Most people see blood as life. I see it for what it is: data. Viscosity, oxygenation, platelet count. And for me, something else. A carrier signal. A biological radio frequency broadcasting a song that makes predators drool and prey run.

I switch vials. One for the incinerator, one for the test.

"Just chemistry," I whisper to the empty room. My voice bounces off the white subway tiles. "Just biology."

I uncap the syringe of suppressant—a cloudy, gray liquid that looks like dishwater and costs more than my rent. I don't inject it into the vein; that would be too easy. It has to go intramuscular.

I plunge the needle into my thigh, through the denim, through the muscle. The burn is immediate, a chemical fire spreading through my lymphatic system. It tastes like copper pennies on the back of my tongue. It tastes like safety.

My head falls back against the cold metal of the cabinet behind me. I wait for the fog. It usually takes three minutes for the serum to bind to the hemomantic markers in my blood, to lock down the Omega pheromones that smell like vanilla and ruin, to silence the *hum* of magic that wants to reach out and curdle the milk in the fridge.

One minute. The lights in the ceiling stop vibrating in time with my heartbeat.
Two minutes. The phantom itch under my skin, the urge to *pull* at the blood of the rats scuttling in the alley above, fades to a dull gray static.
Three minutes. I am alone. Just a woman in a basement. Just a doctor.

I exhale, the breath shuddering out of me. I peel the tourniquet off and toss it into the biohazard bin.

My grandmother used to say our blood was a covenant. A promise between the earth and the vein. She said it while they dragged her to the pyre. I say our blood is a liability. It’s a loaded gun I keep in a safety deposit box, and every day I swallow the key.

I start the centrifuge, the whirring sound a mechanical lullaby. I’m safe. The city above is asleep, or as asleep as New York ever gets, and I am buried deep enough that no one can smell me.

Then the motion sensor at the top of the stairs screams.

It’s not a knock. It’s a collision. Bodies hitting the heavy steel security door with the force of a car crash.

I freeze. The suppressant makes me sluggish, my instincts muffled under layers of gray cotton. I should be reaching for the shotgun taped under the exam table. Instead, I’m staring at the monitor, watching the thermal camera feed.

Three heat signatures. Burning white-hot against the cool blue of the stairwell.

They aren't trying to break in. They’re falling against the door. Collapsing.

One of them slides down the metal frame, leaving a smear on the camera lens. It’s not red. In the infrared, heat is white and cold is black. But this… this smear is a void. It’s darker than the ambient temperature. It’s necrotic.

My medical brain overrides my survival instinct. I hit the mag-lock release.

The door swings open, and the smell hits me before they do.

It’s not the copper tang of fresh bleed-out. It’s the sweet, cloying stench of gardenias left to rot in a vase of stagnant water. It smells like a funeral home where the AC has failed.

Three men spill onto the linoleum floor of my triage bay.

The first one, the one who slid, is young. Painfully young. He’s wearing a leather jacket that looks too expensive for the amount of gore slicking the front of it. He hits the floor and curls into a fetal ball, a sound tearing from his throat that is half-sob, half-snarl.

The second is massive. A wall of muscle and tactical gear, moving with a jerky, broken coordination. He stumbles over the boy, his boots skidding in the slick fluid spreading across the floor. He’s growling, a low, tectonic rumble that vibrates in the fluid of my inner ear.

But it’s the third one who stops the air in my lungs.

He doesn't fall. He enters.

He is tall, wearing a charcoal suit that is ruined by the black sludge soaking the left side of his torso. His face is pale, carved from marble and cruelty, framed by dark hair streaked with silver. He moves with a terrifying, unnatural stillness, even as he bleeds. He looks at me, and I feel the weight of his gaze like a physical touch, a thumb pressing against my trachea.

"Help us," he says.

It’s not a request. It’s a command delivered in a voice that sounds like it hasn't asked for anything in a thousand years.

I step forward, my sneakers squeaking on the tile. "Get him on the table. The boy. Now."

The massive one—the Enforcer, my brain supplies, categorizing the threat—snaps his head toward me. His eyes are blown wide, the irises a frantic, muddy gold. He bares his teeth. They are serrated. A dhampir. A hybrid. Unstable on a good day, lethal on a bad one.

"Don't fucking look at him," the dhampir snarls, placing himself between me and the boy. "Don't touch him."

"Thorn," the tall one says. Softly. Deadly. "Stand down."

Thorn shudders, fighting his own instincts, but he steps aside. He scoops the boy up as if he weighs nothing—a ragdoll of trendy clothes and dying flesh—and deposits him on the central exam table.

I snap on a pair of nitrile gloves, the elastic *thwack* against my wrists loud in the sudden silence. I move into the zone. The fear is still there, a cold stone in my gut, but I pack it away. I am a machine. I am an instrument of diagnosis.

"Symptoms?" I demand, grabbing a penlight.

"Sudden onset," the tall one answers. He’s leaning against the wall now, his hand pressed to his side. Black blood oozes between his fingers, thick as tar. "Twelve hours ago. Weakness. Hallucinations. Then the hemorrhage."

I pry the boy’s eyelid open. Julian. His name is Julian; I saw it on the intake forms of the vampire underground network I monitor but never join. His pupil is blown, the sclera—the white of the eye—completely black. Not black with pigment. Black with necrosis.

"He’s burning up," I say, touching his forehead. It’s scorching, dry heat, like touching a stovetop. "Vampires don't run fevers."

"We do now," Julian gasps. His voice is wet, bubbling. He grabs my wrist. His grip is surprisingly weak, his fingers trembling. "It feels… like spiders. Inside my veins."

I look at his arm. The veins are standing out, black ropes against his pale skin, pulsing with an irregular, chaotic rhythm. It’s not a virus. Viruses are biological. They follow rules. This is anarchy.

"I need to check the others," I say, pulling my hand away. Julian whimpers at the loss of contact.

I turn to the dhampir, Thorn. He’s pacing the small perimeter of the room, his hands opening and closing into fists. He’s bleeding from the nose and ears, thick black rivulets tracking through the heavy stubble on his jaw.

"Sit," I point to the stool.

He glares at me. "I’m fine."

"You’re bleeding from your cranial orifices," I say flatly. "Sit down or fall down, big guy. Your choice."

He sits. The stool creaks under his weight. I check his pulse. It’s racing, a jackhammer against my fingertips. But beneath the rot smell, there’s something else coming off him. Musk. Pine needles. Violence. It cuts through my suppressants, a sharp note that makes my mouth water.

I shove the reaction down. *Chemicals,* I remind myself. *Just biology.*

"And you," I say, turning to the leader. Valerius. The Sire of the city. The monster mothers warn their daughters about.

He hasn't moved from the wall. The pool of black blood at his feet is growing.

"I am manageable," he says. His eyes are locked on me. They are ancient, the color of old moss and cold stone. They are dissecting me. "Save Julian."

"I can't save anyone until I know what I’m fighting," I snap. "Get on the second table. Shirt off."

He hesitates. For a second, I think he’s going to refuse, to let his pride kill him right here in my basement. Then he pushes off the wall. He moves with a fluid grace that makes the hair on my arms stand up. He undoes his jacket, letting it drop to the floor with a wet *thud*. Then the shirt.

His chest is a landscape of marble and scars. But the wound on his side isn't a cut. It’s a rupture. The skin has simply given way, dissolving into that black sludge.

I step closer. The smell is overwhelming here. It’s the scent of deep earth, of things buried for centuries, mixed with the sharp, acidic tang of the sickness.

"I need to draw a sample directly from the wound site," I say. My voice sounds steady. Good.

I pick up a long-bore needle. I have to lean in. I have to enter his personal space.

As I step between his spread knees, the air changes. The fluorescent lights seem to dim. The hum of the freezer drops an octave.

I am inches from him. I can feel the heat radiating off his skin—a cold fire. I can see the individual pores, the silver threads in the dark hair on his chest.

I position the needle.

"You smell," Valerius murmurs, his voice a low vibration that travels through my sternum, "of fear. And vanilla."

My hand freezes.

The suppressant. It’s failing. The sheer proximity of three Alphas in high-stress distress is burning through my chemical firewall like a blowtorch through tissue paper.

"Antiseptic," I correct him, my voice tight. "I smell of antiseptic."

"No," he whispers.

He shifts. His hand, large and cold, comes up to rest on my hip.

It’s meant to be stabilizing. A patient steadying himself. But his thumb digs into the soft flesh above my waistband, just a fraction of an inch.

*Snap.*

The reality of the clinic fractures.

In my mind, the needle clatters to the floor. In my mind, I don't pull away. I step closer. I step *into* him.

*The fantasy hits me with the force of a physical blow. The white tiles vanish, replaced by shadow. He isn't the patient. He is the executioner.*

*His hand on my hip slides up, heavy and possessive, tracing the line of my ribs until it wraps around my throat. He doesn't squeeze; he anchors. He tilts my head back, exposing the jugular that has been pulsing a frantic invitation since he walked in.*

*I am straddling him on the exam table. My lab coat is gone. My skin is flushed, fever-hot, desperate for the cool slide of his touch. He looks at me not with the detached arrogance of a king, but with the starving focus of a wolf.*

*"You thought you could hide?" his voice is in my ear, in my head, dragging claws down my spine. "You thought you could suppress this?"*

*He bites. Not gently. He tears into the junction of my neck and shoulder, and the pain is a white-hot spike that shatters into pleasure so intense my vision grays out. I feel my blood leaving me, rushing into him, feeding the ancient, dark thing that lives in his chest. And in return, I feel his power flooding into me—cold, heavy, intoxicating.*

*I am drowning in him. I am digging my nails into his shoulders, begging him to take more, to drain me dry, to hollow me out until I am nothing but a vessel for his will.*

*My hips grind down against him, seeking friction, seeking ruin. I want to be unmade.*

A metal clang rings out.

I gasp, jerking back.

I dropped the kidney dish. It spins on the floor, a loud, accusing wobble of stainless steel.

I am standing between his knees. The needle is still in my hand, hovering inches from his skin. I am shaking. My breath is coming in short, ragged gasps, loud in the quiet room.

Valerius hasn't moved. His hand is still on my hip.

He isn't looking at the dropped dish. He is looking at my face. He is watching the flush crawl up my neck. He is watching my pupils dilate.

He knows.

He feels the heat radiating off me, the sudden, betraying slickness between my legs that the suppressants should have prevented.

His thumb moves. A slow, deliberate stroke against my hip bone.

"Careful, little doctor," he says. The honorific sounds like an obscenity in his mouth. "Your hands are shaking."

I force myself to breathe. *In. Out. You are a professional. You are a fortress.*

"Hypoglycemia," I lie. The word tastes like ash. "I haven't eaten."

I step back, breaking the contact. The loss of his touch feels like peeling off a layer of skin. I retrieve the dish with fumbling fingers, hating the way my body feels—heavy, sensitized, treacherous.

"Let's get this over with," I mutter.

I jam the needle into the necrotic tissue at his side. He doesn't flinch. He just watches me, his eyes dark with a hunger that has nothing to do with food and everything to do with the monster I’m trying to keep in its cage.

I draw the black fluid. It’s thick. Viscous. It swirls in the barrel of the syringe like smoke.

I retreat to the microscope station, putting the width of the room between us. I need distance. I need glass lenses and cold facts.

I smear the sample onto a slide, my hands trembling as I lower the cover slip. I switch on the backlight. I adjust the focus.

I look into the lens, expecting to see bacteria. Cell death. Toxins.

What I see makes the blood drain from my face.

The cells aren't dying. They are fighting.

Under the magnification, the black fluid isn't biological waste. It’s living shadow. Tiny, jagged shards of darkness are attacking the red blood cells, piercing the membranes and drinking the cytoplasm. But they aren't just destroying; they are rewriting. They are leaving behind glowing purple trails of energy.

Sigils. Microscopic runes carved into the blood itself.

I pull back from the eyepiece, bile rising in my throat.

"This isn't a plague," I whisper.

The room goes silent. Even Julian stops whimpering.

"What is it?" Thorn grunts, clutching his head.

I look at them. Three apex predators brought to their knees not by nature, but by intent.

"It’s a curse," I say. "A hemomantic construct. Someone engineered a spell to target your specific bloodline markers and turn your own immortality against you."

Valerius closes his eyes. "Witches."

"Not just witches," I say, walking back to the slide, unable to look away from the beautiful, terrible destruction under the glass. "This is high-level blood magic. It’s self-replicating. It feeds on magical density. The stronger you are, the faster it kills you."

"Can you cure it?" Julian asks. His voice is barely a whisper. "Please. I don't want to die again."

I look at the rack of chemicals on my wall. Antibiotics. Antivirals. Chelation agents. None of them will touch this. You can't chemotherapy a curse. You can't out-prescribe magic.

There is only one way to filter a magical pathogen from the blood. You need a filter that is compatible with both the magic and the biology. You need a living dialysis machine that can eat the curse and survive the toxicity.

You need a hemomancer.

You need a blood witch.

You need me.

I look at my hands. They look pale, harmless. But I know what happens when I stop the suppressants. I know what happens when I let the hunger out.

If I do this—if I use my magic to clean their blood—I will have to drop the shields. I will have to taste them. I will have to let the monster take the wheel.

And once she’s driving, I don't know if I can ever put her back in the trunk.

I look at Valerius. He’s watching me with that terrible, knowing stillness. He sees the calculation in my eyes. He sees the moment I realize that my anonymity is over.

"You know what I am," I say to him. It’s not a question.

"I suspected," Valerius says. "Now I know."

"If I do this," I say, my voice trembling, "I can't guarantee your safety. When I open that door... I am dangerous."

Thorn laughs, a wet, hacking sound. "Sweetheart, look at us. We’re already dead. Dangerous is an upgrade."

I take a deep breath. The antiseptic air fills my lungs, but it can't scrub away the scent of gardenias and rot. It can't scrub away the vanilla scent rising from my own skin, stronger now, sweeter.

I walk over to the locked cabinet—the one with the biohazard symbol and the heavy padlock. I dial the combination. My fingers feel numb.

I open the door and take out the kit I swore I’d never use. The obsidian ceremonial dagger. The silver transfusion lines. The binding straps.

I turn back to them.

"Get on the tables," I say. My voice is different now. Deeper. Resonant. The voice of the woman in the mirror who isn't wearing a lab coat. "Strap yourselves in."

"Why?" Julian asks, eyeing the leather restraints.

I pick up the dagger. The obsidian blade drinks the light.

"Because," I say, walking toward Valerius, "this is going to hurt. And if you aren't tied down, you’re going to try to kill me."

I stop in front of the Sire. I don't ask for permission this time. I reach out and run my thumb over the vein in his neck, the same one I imagined biting moments ago. His pulse jumps against my skin.

"And because," I add, meeting his ancient gaze, "I’m not going to use medicine."

I bring the dagger to my own palm.

"I’m going to use myself."
