The spine of the 18th-century family bible is snapped clean through, a catastrophic injury for a book, like a severed spinal cord. It sits on my worktable, smelling of mildew and the specific, cloying sweetness of rot that only comes from the Mississippi River flooding a basement.

I exhale, a sharp stream of air through my nose, and pick up the bone folder.

*Focus.*

The world outside *L’Oubli* is a humid, screaming mess. New Orleans in August is less a city and more a fever dream, a place where the air is so thick you have to chew it before you can breathe. But in here, the climate is aggressively controlled. Sixty-eight degrees. Forty percent humidity. The air smells of vanilla—from the lignin decaying in the old paper—and hide glue. It smells like order. It smells like silence.

I slide the bone folder under the lifted leather of the bible’s cover. The tactile feedback is grounding: the resistance of the dried paste, the grain of the calfskin, the microscopic vibration of separation.

*Scrape. Lift. Clean.*

There is a rhythm to restoration that acts as a sedative. If I focus entirely on the millimeter of glue I am removing, I don't have to notice the static in the corners of the room.

I don't look up. I never look up if I can help it. But I can feel it. The "static" is my own private terminology for the things that shouldn't be there. It starts as a pressure in the sinuses, a high-pitched whine that isn't sound but sensation. It’s the feeling of being watched by something that doesn't have eyes.

*Ignore it. You’re just tired. You’re twenty-eight years old, you pay taxes, you don't see monsters.*

My hand slips. The bone folder gouges a tiny, pale scratch into the dark leather.

"Merde," I whisper.

I press my thumb over the scratch, rubbing in a circular motion, letting the oils from my skin darken the mistake. My heart does a traitorous little gallop against my ribs. The static is louder today. It’s been getting louder for weeks, a rising tide of visual noise that makes the shadows look like they’re breathing.

"Miss?"

I jump, the tool clattering onto the table.

A tourist stands at the counter, holding a pristine copy of a local guidebook. He looks soft, sweaty, and entirely harmless. He looks like a man who sleeps through the night. I hate him a little bit for it.

"Sorry," I say, and my voice sounds rusty, like a hinge that hasn't been oiled. I smooth the front of my blouse. It’s high-necked, buttoned to the throat despite the heat outside. I like the containment. I like knowing exactly where my edges are. "Can I help you?"

He buys the book. He makes small talk about the humidity. I give him the practiced, thin smile that doesn't reach my eyes—the one that says *I am a polite service worker, please stop perceiving me.*

He leaves. The bell above the door jingles—a bright, brassy sound that usually signals safety.

But as the door swings shut, the vibration of the bell doesn't stop. It travels down the doorframe, across the floorboards, and up through the soles of my boots. It hits my pelvis and hums there, a tuning fork struck against bone.

The air in the shop shifts. The temperature doesn't drop, exactly; it just... empties. The vanilla scent vanishes, replaced by something metallic and sharp, like a mouthful of pennies.

I grip the edge of the counter. *Don't look at the corners.*

But the silence is heavy. It presses against my eardrums, demanding attention. It feels like a hand at the nape of my neck.

#### * * *

I need to put the bible away. I need to climb the ladder to the upper shelves, file the project in the drying press, and lock the door. Routine. Routine is the antidote.

I walk to the rolling library ladder at the back of the shop. My hands are trembling. I hate my hands. I hate that they betray me when my face is a perfect mask of boredom. I grip the rails, the wood polished smooth by a century of other hands, and I begin to climb.

One rung. Two.

The static roars. It’s not a sound anymore; it’s a physical weight.

*You’re hallucinating, Margot. It’s stress. It’s the heat. It’s the fact that you haven’t been touched by another human being in three years.*

I reach the top shelf, my thighs pressing against the ladder’s rails. I slide the bible into its slot.

And then I can’t move.

It’s not paralysis, not medically. My muscles are capable of firing. But the air around me has solidified, turned into a thick, gelatinous substance that holds me in place.

*The shadows.*

I squeeze my eyes shut, but the image burns behind my lids. The shadows in the corner of the ceiling aren't just an absence of light. They are elongating. Stretching. They pour down the wall like crude oil, defying gravity, defying physics.

In my mind—or in the room, I can’t tell, I never can tell—the darkness reaches for me.

*This is a panic attack,* my rational brain insists. *You are hyperventilating.*

*This is a visitation,* my blood answers.

The fantasy hits me with the violence of a car crash. It’s a recurring intrusion, one I’ve fought off a dozen times, but today my shields are paper-thin.

I imagine the shadows coalescing into hands. Not human hands—too long, too cold, the fingers tapering into points that feel like obsidian glass. They don't grab me; they pin me.

One shadow-hand wraps around my left wrist, slamming it against the bookshelf. Then the right. I am crucified against the literature section, suspended twenty feet in the air on a rolling ladder.

A gasp tears out of my throat, loud in the empty shop.

The sensation is terrifyingly specific. I feel the phantom pressure on my wrists, bruising and absolute. I feel the wood of the shelf digging into my shoulder blades. And I feel the presence behind me.

It has no face. It has no name. It is just a wall of impossible cold that presses against my back, molding itself to the curve of my spine.

*Don't move,* the voice in my head whispers. It sounds like gravel grinding together. *If you move, you fall.*

In the hallucination, the entity strips away my control with surgical precision. It doesn't ask. It doesn't negotiate. I feel invisible claws hook into the back of my high-necked blouse. There is a sound of tearing fabric—*rrrip*—and the cool air of the shop hits my skin.

My nipples harden instantly, painfully, scraping against the lace of my corset.

*Stop it,* I tell myself. *Open your eyes. Climb down.*

But I don't. I can’t. My hips buck forward involuntarily, grinding against the ladder rung. The friction is a shock of electric heat that shoots straight to my groin.

The shadow-presence leans in. I feel a mouth—cold, dead, hungry—press against the sensitive cord of muscle in my neck. It doesn't kiss; it tastes. It inhales. It feels like being submerged in ice water, that burning, numbing shock that makes your lungs seize.

"Please," I whimper. I don't know what I'm begging for. Release? Or more?

The entity’s hand slides around my waist. It is massive, the fingers spanning my entire stomach, the thumb pressing hard into my navel. It flattens my corset against my ribs, squeezing the air out of me.

I am a specimen. I am a meal.

The hand drifts lower.

My knees buckle, and I would fall if the hallucination wasn't holding me up. The phantom fingers slide over the heavy wool of my skirt, seeking the heat between my legs. Even through the layers of fabric—skirt, slip, panties—the touch feels searingly cold. It’s like being touched by liquid nitrogen.

The contrast breaks me. The heat of my own body, the flush of shame rising up my chest, warring against the unnatural chill of the fantasy.

I grind back against the invisible presence. I am wet. God, I am so wet it feels like a wound weeping. The shame is a hot flush crawling up my neck like an accusation, but it doesn't stop the hunger. The hunger is a distinct, separate animal living in my belly, snapping its jaws.

*Take it,* my mind screams. *Take everything.*

In the vision, the hand bunches my skirt up. I feel the air hit my thighs. I feel the rough, impossible texture of shadow-skin against my inner thigh, dragging upward, rough as a cat’s tongue, inevitable as the tide.

I throw my head back, my neck exposed, offering the jugular. A moan builds in my chest, a desperate, humiliating sound—

*KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.*

The sound is percussive, flat, and aggressively real.

The world snaps back into place so hard I nearly vomit.

The shadows snap back to the corners. The hands vanish. The cold evaporates, leaving me sweating and trembling on the ladder, clinging to the rails like a shipwreck survivor.

I hang there for a moment, gasping, my heart hammering a frantic techno beat against my ribs. My blouse is intact. My skirt is smooth. I am alone.

I am alone, and I am throbbing, my body prepared for a violation that existed entirely in my own broken psyche.

"Hello? Delivery for *L’Oubli*?"

The voice is muffled through the glass of the front door.

I squeeze my eyes shut for one second, forcing the tears back. *Pull yourself together, Margot. You are a professional. You are sane.*

"Coming," I croak.

I climb down the ladder. My legs feel like water. I have to stop halfway to adjust my skirt, even though it hasn't moved. I feel sticky and raw, a mess of conflicting signals. I want to scrub my skin with steel wool. I want to curl up in the dark and finish what the shadows started.

I walk to the door, my heels clicking a sharp, staccato rhythm on the hardwood. *Click-clack. Click-clack.* I use the sound to ground myself. I am solid. The floor is solid.

I unlock the door.

#### * * *

The courier is a kid, maybe twenty, wearing a brown uniform that is stained with sweat at the armpits. He holds a rectangular package wrapped in brown paper and twine.

"Sign here," he says, thrusting a digital pad at me. He doesn't look at me; he's looking at his phone.

I scribble something that looks vaguely like *Delacroix* and hand it back.

"Have a good one," he says, and he's already turning away, already gone, dissolving back into the heat and the noise of the Quarter.

I lock the door behind him. I always lock the door.

I take the package to the counter. It’s heavy for its size. Dense. Like a brick of lead.

And it’s warm.

I frown. The shop is freezing. The courier was outside, yes, but the package feels... internally generated. It radiates a low, steady heat against my palms, like a feverish child’s forehead.

I should put it in the quarantine bin. That’s protocol for new acquisitions. Check for beetles, for mold, for silverfish.

Instead, I reach for the scissors.

The twine snaps with a satisfying *pop*. I peel back the brown paper.

It’s a book. Obviously.

But it’s not just a book.

It’s a octavo-sized volume bound in black leather that has no grain. The leather is perfectly smooth, matte, and light-absorbing. It seems to suck the illumination from the overhead lamps, creating a small void on my countertop. There is no title on the spine, no tooling, no gold leaf. Just black.

I reach out to touch it, and my hand hovers an inch above the cover.

The air between my palm and the book is vibrating.

*Don't touch it,* my survival instinct whispers. It’s the same voice that tells you not to put your hand in a fire, not to step off a ledge. *This is not for you. This is dangerous.*

The static in the room spikes. The high-pitched whine returns, but this time it’s not an annoyance. It’s a harmony. The book is singing to the noise in my head.

My fingertips brush the leather.

I gasp and jerk back.

It’s not leather. It’s skin. It’s warm, living skin. I felt the texture of pores. I felt the faint, rhythmic thud of a pulse beneath the binding.

I stare at it, my breath coming short and fast. This is the Inciting Incident. I don't know how I know that term—maybe from all the novels I sell but never read—but I know that my life is divided into two parts now: Before I touched this book, and After.

The dread is a cold stone in my stomach. I should throw it out the door. I should burn it.

But beneath the dread, coiled tight and hot, is something else.

Curiosity.

And something darker. Recognition.

The book feels like the shadows on the ladder. It feels like the hands that pinned me. It feels like the answer to a question I have spent ten years trying to forget.

My hand moves without my permission. I place my palm flat against the cover.

The warmth rushes up my arm, invasive and intimate. It feels like holding hands with a lover in the dark.

I hook my finger under the cover board.

"Hello," I whisper to the empty room, to the static, to the ghosts I’ve been ignoring since I was eighteen.

I open the book.
