The humidity in Miami doesn’t just make you sweat; it molests you. It’s a heavy, wet hand clamped over your mouth, pressing against your pores until you feel like you’re breathing soup.

I stand on the sidewalk outside Moreno Holdings, letting the heat glaze my skin. I need this. I need the physical discomfort to ground me before I walk into the air-conditioned tomb of the city’s most dangerous predator.

*Check the perimeter.*

Habit, not necessity. My eyes sweep the reflection in the towering glass facade. I see a woman in a charcoal pencil skirt that fits like a second skin, a cream silk blouse tucked in with military precision, and four-inch heels that are essentially legal torture devices.

Her name is Elena Vance. She is a forensic accountant with a degree from Wharton, a minor in art history, and a flexible moral compass. She doesn’t flinch at the sight of blood, provided the zeros in her bank account are sufficient.

I am Camille Reyes. I am an FBI agent who hasn’t slept through the night in three years without chemical assistance. And right now, I am terrified.

Not of the danger -- that, I can handle. I can strip a Glock in eighteen seconds blindfolded. I can recite the Miranda rights in three languages while bleeding out. What terrifies me is the stillness required for this. The absolute suppression of every instinct that screams *run*.

I smooth a nonexistent wrinkle from my hip and push through the revolving doors.

The transition is violent. The wall of heat vanishes, replaced by a blast of recycled air that smells of ozone, expensive floor wax, and money. It’s thirty degrees cooler in here. The sweat drying on the back of my neck turns to ice.

The lobby is a cathedral to capitalism. White marble floors stretch out like a frozen lake, swallowing the sound of footsteps. The walls are sheer glass, looking out onto the sweltering misery of the common people, while inside, the air is scrubbed clean of struggle.

I walk toward the security desk. My heels click a sharp, staccato rhythm -- *clack, clack, clack* -- a metronome counting down the seconds until I ruin my life.

"Elena Vance," I say to the guard. He’s thick-necked, wearing a suit that strains at the shoulders. Ex-military or ex-cartel. In Miami, the Venn diagram is often a circle. "I have an appointment with Mr. Moreno."

He doesn't look at the tablet. He looks at my mouth, then my chest. I let him. Elena would let him. Elena would use it. I tilt my chin up, offering him the line of my throat like a challenge.

"ID," he grunts.

I slide the license across the marble. It’s a masterpiece of forgery, aged perfectly to look lived-in. He scans it, his eyes narrowing, then hands it back. His fingers brush mine -- rough, calloused, intentional.

I don't pull away. I hold his gaze until he blinks.

"Penthouse," he says, pointing to the far bank of elevators. "scan your pass."

"Thank you." My voice is low, smooth. A lie wrapped in velvet.

As I walk away, I feel his eyes on my ass. It makes my skin crawl, a phantom itching sensation I want to scratch off with steel wool. *Compartmentalize, Reyes. Put it in the box.*

The elevator is a glass cylinder that shoots upward like a bullet. My ears pop. The city shrinks below me, the chaotic sprawl of traffic and palm trees reducing to a silent, abstract painting. I count the floors. Forty. Forty-five. Fifty.

I check my reflection in the chrome paneling. My hair is pulled back so tight it pulls at my temples, severe and sharp. My lipstick is a shade called *Blood Oath* -- a dark, bruised red. I look like a woman who cuts her fruit with a scalpel.

*Breathe.*

The elevator dings. The doors slide open.

There is no receptionist. No waiting room with stale magazines. Just a vast expanse of open space, floor-to-ceiling windows, and a silence so profound it feels pressurized.

And him.

Rafael Moreno is standing by the far window, his back to me. He’s looking out at the bay, his posture relaxed, hands in the pockets of a suit that costs more than my father made in a decade.

He doesn’t turn around. He knows I’m here. The acoustics in this room are designed to amplify intrusion.

"Ms. Vance," he says.

His voice hits me in the center of my chest. It’s not loud, but it carries a resonance that vibrates through the floorboards. It’s dark, textured like raw silk dragging over gravel.

"Mr. Moreno." I step out of the elevator. The doors close behind me, sealing me in. "I was told 2:00 PM. I'm three minutes early."

"Time is the only currency you can't launder," he says, finally turning.

The dossier didn't do him justice. The photos in the FBI database were grainy surveillance shots or stiff society page portraits. They captured the features -- the high, aristocratic cheekbones, the heavy brow, the mouth that looks like it was carved from marble -- but they missed the energy.

He is beautiful in the way a storm front is beautiful. Terrifyingly symmetric. His eyes are dark, nearly black, but they catch the light from the window, reflecting a cold, sharp intelligence. He moves toward me, and the air in the room seems to displace, rushing to fill the wake of his body.

He stops five feet away. Too close for a business meeting. Far enough that I can't strike without telegraphing it.

"You come highly recommended, Elena," he says. He doesn't offer his hand. He just looks at me. Not at my chest, not at my legs, but right into my eyes. It feels invasive, like he’s reading the serial numbers on my soul. "Wharton. Top of your class. Discharged from your last firm for... 'creative interpretations of tax law.'"

"I prefer 'aggressive asset protection,'" I say. My heart is hammering a frantic rhythm against my ribs -- *thump-thump-thump* -- but my voice is steady. "My previous employers lacked imagination."

"And you think I have imagination?"

"I think you have complex international holdings that require a delicate touch. And I think you pay better than the IRS."

A corner of his mouth ticks up. It’s not a smile. It’s an acknowledgment of a hit.

"Come."

He walks to his desk -- a massive slab of petrified wood resting on steel beams -- and sits. He gestures to the chair opposite him.

I sit. The leather is cool against the backs of my thighs. I cross my legs, deliberate and slow. He watches the movement. He doesn't leer, he *observes*. Like a biologist watching a specimen under a slide.

"My business," he begins, picking up a heavy fountain pen and turning it over in his long fingers, "is legitimate. We deal in logistics, shipping, real estate."

"Of course," I say. "Legitimacy is the goal."

"However," he continues, his voice dropping an octave, becoming intimate, "legacy creates... debris. My father built this company with certain methodologies that are no longer compatible with my vision. I need someone to clean up the history without toppling the structure."

He’s talking about money laundering. He’s talking about burying the bodies of his father’s sins under layers of shell companies and offshore trusts.

"I’m a janitor, Mr. Moreno," I say, leaning forward slightly. "Not a priest. I don't need confessions. I just need access to the books."

He stops spinning the pen. He leans back, studying me. The silence stretches, taut and heavy. I force myself not to fidget. I force myself to breathe shallowly, so my chest doesn't rise and fall too visibly.

"You’re tense," he observes.

"I’m interviewing for a job that could send me to federal prison if I’m sloppy. Tension is a survival mechanism."

"Or," he says, standing up again. He moves around the desk. My muscles lock. *Threat assessment: High.* He moves with a liquid grace that belies his size. He’s tall, over six-two, broad-shouldered but lean. "You’re hiding something."

He stops behind my chair.

The hair on my arms stands up. I can smell him now. Not cologne, but something beneath it. Soap. Cedar. And the faint, metallic scent of adrenaline.

"Everyone is hiding something," I say to the empty desk in front of me. I don't turn around. I can feel his heat radiating against my back.

"True." His voice is right at my ear now. I suppress a shiver that tries to snake down my spine. "Tell me, Elena. What are you afraid of?"

"Getting caught," I lie.

"No." He leans down. His hand comes into view, resting on the back of my chair, inches from my shoulder. His fingers are long, manicured, lethal. "You’re not afraid of the law. You’re too arrogant for that. You’re afraid of something else."

He’s baiting me. Psychology 101. Break the subject down, find the crack.

"I'm afraid of wasting my time," I snap, turning my head to look at him.

It’s a mistake.

He’s closer than I thought. My nose almost brushes his jaw. I can see the grain of his skin, the dark ring of his iris. The air between us is suddenly charged, thick with static.

For a second, the agent in me vanishes. The calculation, the mission, the dead partner -- it all dissolves into white noise. All I am is a body, reacting to a superior force. My stomach drops, a sickening, delicious swoop of vertigo.

*Get it together, Reyes.*

"Bold," he murmurs. His gaze drops to my mouth, lingers there for a heartbeat that lasts a year, then flicks back up. "I like bold."

He straightens up, breaking the spell. The loss of his proximity is physically jarring, like stepping out of a warm bath into a drafty room.

"Here." He picks up a tablet from the desk and slides it toward me. "These are the accounts for a subsidiary in Panama. Shipping containers. The manifest says we moved three million in textiles last quarter. The bank statements show four million in deposits."

He leans his hip against the edge of the desk, crossing his arms. The fabric of his trousers pulls tight across his thighs. I look away, focusing on the screen.

"Find the ghost," he says.

It’s a test. A competency exam.

I pick up the tablet. My hands are steady, thank God. I scroll through the spreadsheets. It’s a mess. Layers of obfuscation, circular transactions, inflated invoices. It’s amateur hour.

"Whoever did this was lazy," I say, tapping the screen. "See this? Recurring payments to a vendor listed as 'Maintenance.' The amounts are prime numbers. Always just under the ten-thousand-dollar reporting threshold."

I look up at him. "Structuring. It’s the first thing the Feds look for. It’s practically a neon sign saying 'Look at me, I’m laundering drug money.'"

"And the extra million?"

"Inventory shrinkage," I say, scrolling down. "They’re writing off product that never existed to balance the influx of cash. But they messed up the weight ratios on the shipping manifests. You can't ship three million dollars of silk in a container that weighs as much as a container of lead."

I set the tablet down. "You don't need an accountant, Mr. Moreno. You need to fire your cousin."

He laughs.

It’s a low, rusty sound, like he hasn't used it in years. It transforms his face, crinkling the corners of his eyes, making him look younger, less like a statue and more like a man.

"Hector isn't my cousin," he says. "But you're right. He is sloppy."

He walks back around the desk, but he doesn't sit. He stands over me, asserting dominance.

"The job is yours. Probationary period of three months. You work here, in the building. No files leave the premises. No remote access. You answer to me, and only me."

"And the salary?"

"Double whatever you’re thinking."

"Done."

I stand up. My legs feel shaky, the adrenaline crash beginning to set in. I need to get out of here. I need to go back to my shitty apartment in Hialeah, strip off these clothes, and scrub my skin until it’s raw.

"One more thing," he says.

I pause. "Yes?"

He reaches out. For a second, I think he’s going to shake my hand.

Instead, his hand lands on the small of my back.

The contact burns through the silk of my blouse like a brand. His palm is warm, heavy, possessive. It’s a guiding touch, steering me toward the door, but it feels like a claim.

*Trigger.*

My mind betrays me instantly. The sensory input -- the heat of his hand, the smell of cedar and danger, the isolation of the room -- short-circuits my logic.

*I imagine the door locking. I imagine that heavy hand sliding from my back to my throat, pinning me against the cold glass of the window. I imagine him pressing into me, the rough wool of his suit scratching my bare legs, the city of Miami spread out below us as he takes what he wants.*

*I imagine surrendering. Not fighting. Not analyzing. Just... stopping.*

The image is so vivid, so violent and wet, that I gasp. A tiny, sharp intake of breath.

His fingers tighten slightly on my waist. Just a fraction. He heard it. He felt the hitch in my breathing.

He leans in, his mouth hovering near my ear.

"Be careful, Elena," he whispers. "This world... it eats soft things."

He pulls back, his hand dropping away. The absence of his touch is an ache.

"I'm not soft," I say. My voice sounds wrecked to my own ears.

"We'll see."

#### * * *

The ride down in the elevator is a blur. I don't count the floors. I lean my forehead against the cool metal of the door and close my eyes.

My heart is galloping. My palms are slick. And lower, between my thighs, there is a traitorous, heavy pulse of heat.

I hate him. I hate the way he looked at me, like he knew exactly what I was thinking. I hate that for five seconds, I forgot the mission. I forgot the dead partner. I forgot that I am the good guy.

I walk out of the building and into the heat. The humidity hits me again, suffocating and gross.

I pull my phone from my purse. My hands are trembling. I dial the number that doesn't exist on any phone bill.

"Report," Vance’s voice barks. Dry. Patrician. Hateful.

"I'm in," I say.

"Good. Did he suspect anything?"

I look back at the tower of glass and steel. I can’t see the penthouse from here, but I can feel it. I can feel him up there, watching the city, watching me.

"No," I say, the lie tasting like ash on my tongue. "He suspects nothing."

"Establish the baseline. Find the dirt. Don't get comfortable, Reyes."

"Understood."

I hang up.

I hail a cab, sliding into the cracked vinyl seat. As we pull away into the snarled traffic of Brickell, I look down at my hand. It’s still shaking.

I clench it into a fist.

*I am not soft.*

But as the skyline blurs past, all I can feel is the phantom weight of his hand on the small of my back, pushing me toward the edge. And the terrifying realization that part of me -- the dark, starving part I keep locked in a cage -- wants to jump.
