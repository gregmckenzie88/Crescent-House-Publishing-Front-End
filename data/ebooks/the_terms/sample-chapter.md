The typo is a microscopic fracture in the hull of my day.

It sits there on page forty-two of the due diligence report, a misplaced decimal point that transforms a three-million-dollar liability into a rounding error. A junior associate’s fatigue, likely. A simple slip of the finger. But as I stare at it, the black ink seems to vibrate against the stark white paper, pulsing like a fresh bruise.

Two years ago, a similar oversight—planted by a man I shared a bed with—cost me my reputation, my equity, and the ability to sleep through the night without chemical assistance.

I don't scream. Screaming is for people who believe the world cares about their distress. I circle the error with a red pen, the movement precise, surgical. I cap the pen. The click sounds like a gunshot in the hushed, climate-controlled sterility of my office.

"Elara," I say. I don't raise my voice. I don't have to.

My paralegal appears in the doorway three seconds later. She knows the cadence of my silence. She is soft where I am angular, efficient where I am obsessive. She takes the document from my outstretched hand.

"Page forty-two," I say, turning my chair toward the window. Chicago is gray today, the kind of oppressive, flat slate that suggests the sky has simply given up. "Tell Marcus he has twenty minutes to reprint the entire binder. If he can’t manage that, he can spend the afternoon updating his LinkedIn profile."

"Understood, Simone."

She leaves. The door clicks shut.

I exhale, a long, controlled stream of air through my nose. My heart is doing something erratic—a hummingbird battering its wings against the cage of my ribs—but my hands are steady. I check them. I hold them out over the mahogany desk, fingers splayed. *Steady.*

Control is not a state of being; it is an active, muscular endurance sport.

I stand and walk to the floor-to-ceiling mirror hidden inside the closet door. The woman staring back is a fortress. My hair is pulled back so tightly it pulls the skin at my temples taut, a headache waiting to happen, but it’s worth it for the severity. The suit is charcoal wool, tailored to within an inch of its life. The skirt ends exactly at the knee. The silk blouse is buttoned to the throat.

I am armored. I am sealed. There is no point of entry.

*Julian would hate this suit,* I think, the thought intruding like a needle. *He liked me in pastels. He liked me soft so he could mold me.*

I push the thought down into the acidic pit of my stomach. Julian Vane is the past. Today is the merger. Today is Adrian Cross.

I check my watch. The face is unadorned, masculine. 1:45 PM.

The acquisition of Kinetix Tech should be straightforward. My client is desperate to sell; Adrian Cross’s venture capital firm, Acheron, is hungry to buy. But "straightforward" is a lie lawyers tell clients to keep them calm. Adrian Cross has a reputation. He doesn't just buy companies; he dissects them. He strips them for parts. He finds the rot and cuts it out without anesthesia.

I grab my briefcase. The leather handle is cool and hard, a grounding tether.

*Don't blink,* I tell my reflection. *Don't apologize. Don't bleed.*

#### * * *

The Spire is an architectural middle finger to the laws of physics—a glass needle piercing the cloud cover on the edge of Lake Michigan. The conference room, ominously titled "The Boardroom," is on the forty-fifth floor.

The elevator ride is a silent pressurized ascent that makes my ears pop. When the doors slide open, the air changes. It’s colder up here. The ambient noise of the city is gone, replaced by a silence so profound it feels heavy, like water pressure.

I walk into the room, my heels striking the polished concrete floor with a rhythmic, martial *clack-clack-clack*.

I am five minutes early. He is already there.

Adrian Cross is standing at the window, his back to me. He is taller than his photos suggest—broad shoulders filling out a navy suit that costs more than my first car. He isn't looking at his phone or reviewing files. He’s just staring out at the turbulent gray water of the lake, his hands clasped loosely behind his back.

He turns as I approach the table.

The air in the room seems to contract.

He is… devastating. Not in the pretty, polished way of the corporate sharks I usually circle. He has a face made of hard planes and intent. His hair is dark, swept back with a carelessness that suggests he has better things to do than look in a mirror. But it’s his eyes that stop me. They are dark, intelligent, and completely devoid of the usual social gloss. He looks at me not as a person, but as a variable he has already solved.

"Ms. Laurent," he says. His voice is a low rumble, a bass note that I feel in the soles of my feet.

"Mr. Cross." I set my briefcase down. I do not smile. Smiling is a submission signal. "I trust I haven't kept you waiting."

"I like to arrive early," he says, moving toward me. He moves with a predator’s grace—fluid, silent, wasted energy nonexistent. "It gives me time to assess the terrain."

He extends a hand.

I take it.

His hand engulfs mine. It is warm, dry, and terrifyingly solid. His skin is rough—callouses on the palm, friction burns of a life lived outside a boardroom. He doesn't squeeze too hard, but the grip is absolute. For a second, just one fractional second, he doesn't let go when the shake is finished. He holds me there, connected, his thumb brushing the sensitive skin of my wrist where my pulse is currently trying to hammer its way out.

A jolt of electricity, sharp and hot, shoots up my arm and pools in my lower belly.

I snatch my hand back. The reaction is too fast, too defensive.

His eyes narrow slightly. A micro-expression. Curiosity? Amusement?

"Please," he gestures to the chair opposite him. "Sit."

It sounds like a command, not an invitation.

I sit. I arrange my files. I align the edges of the binder with the edge of the table. I uncap my pen. I build my little wall of paper and plastic.

"I’ve reviewed the preliminary term sheet," I say, my voice crisp. I am channeling the Ice Queen. I am the smartest person in the room. I am untouchable. "The valuation your team proposed is aggressive, Mr. Cross. And not in a complimentary sense. You’re undervaluing Kinetix’s IP portfolio by at least twenty percent."

Adrian leans back in his chair. He doesn't look at his files. He looks at me. He watches my mouth move, then lifts his gaze to my eyes. It’s unnerving. Most men look at my chest, or my legs, or the clock. He looks at *me*.

"The IP is stagnant," he says calmly. "The code hasn't been updated in eighteen months. The patent on the core algorithm expires in three years. I'm not paying for a depreciating asset."

"The algorithm is the industry standard," I counter. "And the user base is loyal."

"The user base is trapped," he corrects. "High switching costs are the only thing keeping them. That’s not loyalty, Simone. That’s hostage-taking."

*Simone.*

He uses my first name like he has the right to it. It rolls off his tongue with a familiarity that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

"Ms. Laurent," I correct him, my voice dropping a degree.

"Simone suits you better," he says. He isn't mocking me. He’s stating a fact, like the color of the sky. "Laurent sounds like a shield. Simone sounds like… someone who listens."

My heart skips a beat. *Simone. He knows the etymology.*

"I am here to negotiate a merger, Mr. Cross. Not to discuss nomenclature."

"Everything is a negotiation," he says softly. "We are negotiating right now. You are negotiating how much distance you can keep between us. I am negotiating how close I can get to see what’s behind that wall you’ve built."

I stiffen. "My client—"

"Your client is a drowning man," Adrian interrupts, but his voice doesn't rise. It just gets heavier. "He needs a lifeboat. I am the only ship in the water. We both know this. So let’s stop pretending you have leverage and talk about the terms of surrender."

*Surrender.*

The word hangs in the air, vibrating.

My body betrays me. At the word *surrender*, my thighs clench together under the table. A flush of heat, wet and shameful, blooms between my legs. It creates a sudden, sharp contrast to the air-conditioned chill of the room.

I hate him. I hate the way he sits there, legs spread, taking up space, looking at me like he knows exactly what that word did to me.

"We are not surrendering," I say, and I hate that my voice sounds slightly breathless. "We are restructuring."

"Semantics." He leans forward, resting his elbows on the table. He clasps his hands. "Let’s talk about the liquidation clause. Section 4.2."

I flip to the page, grateful for the distraction of text. "Standard language. In the event of dissolution—"

"I want full discretion," he says. "If I acquire the entity, I decide what stays and what goes. If I want to strip it down to the studs, I will. If I want to liquidate the assets, I will."

He pauses. His gaze drops to my hands, which are gripping the pen so hard my knuckles are white.

"I have a talent for liquidation," he says, his voice dropping to a gravelly purr. "For finding the value in things that have been discarded. For taking something rigid... and making it fluid."

The double entendre is blatant, arrogant, and utterly filthy.

I look up, ready to eviscerate him. Ready to cite harassment, to threaten a walkout, to throw the heavy binder at his head.

But I don't.

Because his eyes are locked on mine, and they are dark with a hunger that has nothing to do with business. He isn't looking at me like a victim. He's looking at me like a challenge. Like a puzzle he intends to solve with his hands.

"I don't think," I say, my voice tight, "that my client would be comfortable with that level of exposure."

"And you?" Adrian asks. "Are you comfortable, Simone?"

The silence stretches. The room feels suddenly microscopic. I can smell him—sandalwood, espresso, and the metallic tang of ozone. It’s the smell of a storm about to break.

I want to run. I want to gather my files and sprint to the elevator and go back to my office where the air is sterile and the variables are controlled.

But deeper than that, in a place I have tried to starve into silence for two years, I want to stay. I want to see what happens if I don't look away.

"I am perfectly comfortable," I lie.

Adrian smiles. It’s a slow, terrifying expression. It doesn't reach his eyes. His eyes remain deadly serious.

"Good," he says. "Because we have a long afternoon ahead of us. And I prefer to be thorough."

He reaches for the water pitcher. As he pours, I watch the muscles in his forearm shift under the fine wool of his suit. I imagine those hands on me—not shaking my hand, but pinning it. Holding me down. Forcing me to stop thinking, stop planning, stop fighting.

The thought is a traitor. I kill it instantly.

I pick up my pen. I refuse to look at his hands again.

"Section 4.3," I say, my voice like chipped ice. "Let's discuss the severance packages."

Adrian takes a sip of water, his eyes over the rim of the glass never leaving my face. He knows. He knows I'm rattled. He knows I'm lying.

"Proceed," he says.

And we begin.

#### * * *

Three hours later, the room is a battlefield of paper.

The sun has set, turning the glass walls into black mirrors reflecting our own exhaustion. My blouse feels stuck to my back. My neck aches from the tension of holding my head high.

We have argued over every decimal point. We have sparred over employee retention, stock options, and non-competes. Adrian is relentless. He doesn't raise his voice, doesn't posture. He just keeps pushing, probing, finding the weak spots in my arguments and pressing until I have to maneuver or break.

It is the most exhausting intellectual exercise of my life.

It is also the most aroused I have been in a decade.

Every time I score a point, I see a flicker of appreciation in his eyes. Every time he corners me, I feel a spike of adrenaline that feels suspiciously like dopamine.

"We're deadlocked on the earn-out provision," I say, closing the binder. I need a break. I need to pee. I need to splash cold water on my face and remember who I am.

"Agreed," Adrian says. He stretches, his shirt straining across his chest. He looks unbothered, while I feel like I’ve been run through a thresher. "Let’s table it. The building turns the HVAC down after six. It’s getting cold."

It is cold. I’m shivering, though I’ve been trying to hide it.

"I hadn't noticed," I say.

He stands up. He walks around the table. He doesn't stop at his chair. He keeps coming until he is standing next to me.

I freeze. I don't look up. I stare at the knot of his tie. It is a Windsor knot. perfectly symmetrical.

"You're shivering, Simone."

"I'm fine."

"You're cold," he says. "And you're stubborn. It’s a dangerous combination."

He reaches out. I flinch, expecting... I don't know what. A grab? A touch?

He bypasses me entirely and reaches for the thermostat on the wall behind me. But to do it, he has to lean over me.

For two seconds, he is surrounding me. His body is a wall of heat against my side. His arm is a bar across my vision. I can feel the warmth radiating from him, seeping through the layers of my armor. I can hear his breathing—slow, steady, rhythmic.

I stop breathing.

If he lowered his hand, he would touch my shoulder. If he turned his head, his mouth would be on my neck.

I am paralyzed by the proximity. My brain is screaming *danger*, but my body is singing *finally*.

He adjusts the dial. He doesn't move away immediately. He stays there, looming over me, boxing me in.

"You fight well," he murmurs. His voice vibrates through my chair. "Better than I expected."

"I'm expensive," I manage to say. "I have to be good."

"I didn't say you were good," he says, his voice dropping to a whisper that scrapes against my nerves. "I said you fight well. There's a difference. You fight like you have something to prove. Or something to hide."

He pulls back. The loss of his heat is physically painful.

I spin my chair around to face him, adrenaline spiking into anger. "Is there a point to this, Mr. Cross? Or are you just enjoying the sound of your own voice?"

He looks down at me. His expression is unreadable, but his eyes are dark.

"The point," he says, "is that I think you’re tired of fighting, Simone. I think you’re exhausted. And I think, if you were honest with yourself, you’d admit that you’re looking for someone strong enough to make you stop."

The truth of it hits me like a slap. It’s so accurate, so invasive, that I feel naked.

I stand up. I am shaking, and it’s not from the cold.

"The meeting is adjourned," I say. My voice is brittle. "I will have revised terms sent to your office by morning."

I grab my briefcase. I don't wait for him to answer. I turn and walk toward the door, my heels striking the floor hard.

*Get out. Get out. Get out.*

"Simone," he calls out.

I stop at the door. I don't turn around. My hand is on the cool metal of the handle.

"Yes?"

"Wear the blue coat tomorrow," he says. "The black one washes you out."

I rip the door open and step into the hall.

I march to the elevator, jab the button, and stare at the digital numbers as they descend. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear the blood rushing in my ears.

He watched me arrive. He saw my coat. He noticed my skin tone.

He is watching everything.

As the elevator doors close, shutting me into the safety of the steel box, I catch my reflection in the polished metal doors.

My cheeks are flushed a deep, frantic crimson. My eyes are wide and bright. I look like a woman who has just been kissed, or struck, or both.

I lean my forehead against the cold metal and close my eyes.

*Asset liquidation.*

God help me. I am in so much trouble.
