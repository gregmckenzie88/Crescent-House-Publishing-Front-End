The wine tastes like obedience.

It is a 2019 Cabernet from a boutique vineyard in Napa, retailing for three hundred dollars a bottle, and it is desperate to be liked. It hits the center of my tongue with a calculated burst of cassis, follows up with the requisite whisper of vanilla oak, and finishes with tannins so polished they feel like silicone against my gums.

It is technically flawless. It is spiritually dead.

I hold the liquid in my mouth, letting it warm, searching for a flaw, a jagged edge, a mistake—anything that proves a human hand touched this. Nothing. It is juice made by an algorithm.

I spit it into the silver bucket. A precise, sharp stream. No drip.

"Well?"

The junior sommelier, a boy named Tiago who wears suits two sizes too big to compensate for his lack of experience, is vibrating with anxiety. He clutches the bottle by the neck, his knuckles white. The tasting room is a white box suspended twenty floors above São Paulo, hermetically sealed against the humidity and the noise. Here, the air is scrubbed clean, chilled to a constant sixty-five degrees. It smells of nothing.

"It’s a coward’s wine," I say.

Tiago blinks. "I... I’m sorry, Luciana? It got ninety-eight points from *Decanter*."

"It’s terrified of offending anyone," I continue, setting the glass down on the starched white tablecloth. The sound of the stem hitting the fabric is a dull thud, the only noise in the room besides the low hum of the wine fridges. "It has no history. No struggle. It tastes like money and insecurity. It’s perfect for the hotel bar. The Americans will love it."

I pick up my pen—a heavy Montblanc that feels like a weapon—and scratch a single line across my scoring sheet. *Technically sound. Emotionally bankrupt.*

"Do we stock it?" Tiago asks, his voice small.

"Order ten cases. Mark it up four hundred percent." I stand, smoothing the front of my pencil skirt. My hands are cold. They are always cold in here. "It will pair perfectly with the divorce settlements being negotiated in the VIP lounge."

I walk to the window. Below, the city is a gray smear of concrete and desperation, choked by traffic. From up here, through the triple-paned glass, it looks peaceful. Organized. I like it up here. I like the distance. I like that I can see the chaos but I don't have to smell it.

"You're done?" Tiago asks.

"My palate is fatigued by mediocrity," I say, not turning around. "Clear the table. And Tiago?"

"Yes?"

"Polish your shoes. I can see the scuffs from here."

I catch his reflection in the glass. He looks at my back with a mixture of awe and hatred. It’s a look I know well. They call me *A Bisturi*—The Scalpel. They think I don’t know. They think I don’t hear the whispers in the break room about how I dissect wines with the same cold detachment I supposedly used to dissect my marriage.

They are wrong. I didn’t dissect my marriage. I just woke up one day and realized I was married to a man who viewed stability as a personal insult. Eduardo wanted to live in the mess. He wanted paint on the floorboards and screaming matches that ended in sex and unpaid bills that were "part of the process."

I rub the pad of my thumb over my fingertips, a nervous tic I’ve hidden for years. Smooth skin against smooth skin. No friction.

I check my reflection in the window. My hair is pulled back so tight it pulls at my temples, not a strand out of place. My lipstick is the color of dried blood. I look like a woman who has never made a mistake.

*Good.*

#### * * *

Felipe’s office smells of stale espresso and the chemical tang of freshly printed glossies. It is a glass cage in the center of the newsroom, designed to make everyone feel watched, including him.

He is waiting for me, leaning back in his Eames chair, looking disheveled on purpose. Felipe cultivates an air of frantic genius—sleeves rolled up, top button undone, hair purposefully mussed—to hide the fact that he is a ruthless businessman who would sell his own mother for a higher click-through rate.

"You killed the Napa piece," he says without preamble.

I sit opposite him, crossing my legs. "The wine killed itself. I just signed the death certificate."

"The distributor is threatening to pull their ad spend."

"Then tell them to make better wine. Or bribe someone with lower standards. Send Tiago next time. He thinks oak chips are a flavor profile."

Felipe sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face. He looks at me, really looks at me, with those dark, knowing eyes that always make me feel like my blouse is unbuttoned. "You’re bored, Luciana."

"I am efficient."

"You’re bored. And you’re mean when you’re bored. You’re eviscerating vintages that are perfectly fine just to see if they bleed."

"I am the lead critic for *Paladar Elite*," I say, my voice icy. "My job is not to praise 'perfectly fine.' My job is to tell the truth."

"The truth?" Felipe laughs, a dry, barking sound. He reaches for a manila folder on his desk and slides it across the glass surface. It stops exactly at the edge of the table, inches from my hand. "Here’s some truth for you."

I look down at the folder. No title. Just a location code scrawled in black marker: *MZA-UCO*.

"Mendoza?" I look up, raising an eyebrow. "You want me to review Malbecs? Groundbreaking, Felipe. What’s next? A shocking exposé on how sparkling wine from Champagne has bubbles?"

"Not Malbecs. *A* Malbec. One specifically." He taps the folder. "Open it."

I flip the cover.

There is no press release. No glossy sell-sheet with tasting notes and pH levels. Just a photograph, grainy and high-contrast, like it was taken with a long lens.

It shows a man standing in a vineyard. But it’s not the manicured, geometric vineyards of the tourist brochures. The vines are wild, gnarled bushes that look like they’re clawing their way out of the earth. The soil is white with stone. The mountains in the background are jagged teeth tearing at the sky.

The man is looking away from the camera. He is wearing a dirty t-shirt and jeans that are more dust than denim. His arms are crossed, the muscles of his forearms corded and dark. He looks less like a winemaker and more like a brawler waiting for the bell.

"Matías Huencho," Felipe says. "They call him the Ghost of the Andes."

"Dramatic," I drawl, though my eyes linger on the man’s hands. Even in the photo, they look heavy. Stained. "Let me guess. He refuses to export. He speaks to the vines. He thinks biodynamics is a religion. He’s a recluse who makes five hundred bottles a year and sells them only to people who know the secret handshake."

"He makes three thousand bottles," Felipe corrects. "And he sells them to no one."

I pause. "Excuse me?"

"He doesn't sell. He has twenty hectares of ancestral vines in the Uco Valley. Pre-phylloxera stock. Old. Dangerous. He makes the wine, barrels it, bottles it... and then he drinks it. Or pours it out. Or gives it to the locals. No distribution. No reviews. No price tag."

"That’s not a business. That’s a hobby."

"It’s a statement," Felipe says, leaning forward. "Rumor is, it’s the best Malbec in the southern hemisphere. Complex, violent, ancient. But he won’t let anyone taste it. Especially not critics. He chased a writer from *Spectator* off his land with a shovel last year."

"And you want me to go there?" I close the folder. "To get chased with a shovel? I have a dinner with the Rothschild rep on Friday."

"Cancel it." Felipe’s voice drops. "I don't want a review, Luciana. I want a dissection. I want you to go down there, charm your way into his cellar, taste this mythical ghost wine, and tell me if it’s real or if it’s just ego in a bottle. If it’s trash, I want you to destroy the legend. If it’s gold... I want the exclusive."

"I don't do 'charm'," I say flatly. "I do analysis."

"Exactly. You’re the Scalpel. Cut him open."

I stare at the folder. The man, Matías, is turned away, but there is a tension in his posture that radiates off the paper. A stubbornness. It irritates me. It feels like a challenge.

"Why me?" I ask. "Send a man. He looks like the type who measures respect by callus thickness."

Felipe leans back, and his expression softens into something pitying. I hate him for it. "Because, Lu. It’s been five years since the divorce. You’ve turned yourself into a machine. You live in high-rises, you drink wine that costs more than a car, you date men who wear loafers without socks and talk about their portfolios."

"I am happy," I lie. The words taste like ash.

"You are sterile," he says.

The word hits me like a slap. It echoes the last thing Eduardo screamed at me before he threw his easel through the living room window. *You’re sterile, Luciana. Not your body—your soul. You can’t create anything. You can only judge what other people make.*

My breath hitches, just once, a tiny betrayal in my chest. I clamp down on it instantly. I sit up straighter, my spine fusing into a rod of steel.

"Careful, Felipe."

"You need to touch grass," he says, ignoring my tone. "Real grass. Not the ornamental kind in the lobby. Go to Mendoza. Get dirty. Eviscerate this cowboy winemaker if you have to, but for God’s sake, feel something. Even if it’s just hate."

He stands up, signaling the meeting is over.

"His name is Matías Huencho. Finca Los Ancestros. Your flight leaves at six a.m. tomorrow."

I stand, picking up the folder. The cardboard feels rough against my manicured nails. I should throw it in his face. I should quit. I have enough money to never work again. I could spend the rest of my life in climate-controlled rooms, drinking perfect, soulless wine.

"I’ll need an expense account," I say, my voice devoid of tremor. "And hazard pay. In case of shovels."

Felipe smiles, but it doesn't reach his eyes. "Just bring me the story, Lu. Bring me the blood."

#### * * *

My apartment is a study in beige and silence.

It is on the thirtieth floor, ten floors higher than the tasting room. The air here is even thinner, even cleaner. The furniture is Italian leather, low-slung and uncomfortable, chosen for its lines rather than its ability to hold a human body. There are no photographs. The walls are adorned with abstract art—black slashes on white canvas—that I bought because an advisor told me they would appreciate in value.

I kick off my heels by the door. The sound of the stilettos hitting the marble floor echoes, sharp and lonely.

*Sterile.*

The word is a parasite. It burrows under my skin, itching.

I walk into the kitchen, pouring myself a glass of water from the filtration tap. I don't drink wine at home. I don't bring work into the sanctuary. I lean against the quartz countertop, the cold stone seeping through the silk of my blouse.

I open the folder again.

Matías Huencho.

In the harsh light of my kitchen, the photo looks even more alien. I study him. He is broad, heavy-set in a way that suggests density rather than gym muscle. His neck is thick, burned brown by the sun. His hair is dark, shaggy, long enough to curl over his collar.

He looks messy. He looks like sweat and dirt and unwashed denim. He looks like everything I have spent twenty years scrubbing out of my life.

I grew up in a house that smelled of frying oil and humidity, in a neighborhood where the music never stopped. I clawed my way into this silence. I earned this emptiness.

Why does looking at him make my stomach tighten? Not with attraction—God, no. With anxiety. With the distinct, prickly sensation that I am about to lose my footing.

I leave the folder on the counter and walk to the bedroom.

My suitcase is open on the bed. A Rimowa, silver aluminum, dent-proof. Armor.

I need to pack for a vineyard. For dirt. For the Andes.

I walk into my closet, running my hands over the hangers. I should pack denim. I should pack flannel. I should pack sensible boots.

Instead, my hand stops on a blouse of cream silk. It is delicate, translucent, utterly impractical. It stains if you look at it wrong.

I pull it off the hanger.

I pack it.

I pack a pencil skirt in charcoal wool. I pack tailored trousers that require dry cleaning. I pack a pair of black leather boots with a three-inch heel—sharp enough to puncture the earth, not sink into it.

I am not going there to blend in. I am not going there to "touch grass," as Felipe so crudely put it. I am going there as an invasion force.

I will wear my silk like a shield. I will stand in his dirt in my Italian leather heels, and I will remind him, and myself, that I am separate. I am the observer. I am the judge. I am not part of the vintage.

I move to the lingerie drawer. Lace. Satin. Wired structure. Everything I own is designed to shape, to lift, to constrain.

I pick up a bra, black lace, sheer cups. Why am I packing this? Who is going to see it? The winemaker? The sheep?

I hesitate, my thumb tracing the scalloped edge of the lace.

*You need to feel something.*

A sudden, hot flush crawls up my neck. It’s humiliation. It’s anger.

I throw the bra into the suitcase. I throw in the matching panties. I pack them not for a lover, but for me. A secret layer of complexity under the armor. A reminder that underneath the wool and the silk, there is skin. Even if no one touches it.

I zip the suitcase shut. The latch clicks—a definitive, metallic snap that sounds like a pistol cocking.

I turn off the lights. The city glow filters in through the floor-to-ceiling windows, turning the room into a grayscale photograph. I lie down in the center of my king-sized bed, on top of the duvet, fully clothed.

I close my eyes, but the darkness isn't empty. I see the jagged line of the mountains. I smell dust. And for a split second, I imagine the taste of wine that hasn't been filtered, wine that is thick and dark and bitter.

I squeeze my eyes shut tighter.

Tomorrow, I go to war with the earth. And I intend to win.
