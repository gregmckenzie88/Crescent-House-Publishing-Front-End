As corrupt developers circle like vultures and the sultry Caribbean heat strips away her armor piece by piece, Isabela must choose between the safety of her sterile Canadian life and surrendering to a man whose touch promises to burn her perfectly ordered world to ash.",
    "under240": "When Toronto chef Isabela Restrepo returns to Colombia to sell her late mother's crumbling hotel, she expects a quick transaction—until she meets Diego, the ruggedly magnetic caretaker who's kept the colonial property standing for fifteen years. As Isabela battles a corrupt developer determined to steal her inheritance and confronts her family's buried debts, she finds herself drawn into Diego's world of raw passion and Caribbean heat. But when their desperate gambit to save the hotel with a pop-up restaurant ends in flames—literally—Isabela must choose between the safety of her sterile Canadian life and the dangerous, intoxicating pull of a man who sees through her icy facade to the fire beneath. This steamy tale of second chances explores what happens when a woman who's spent decades controlling every variable finally surrenders to the one thing she can't master: desire that burns hotter than the tropical sun.",
