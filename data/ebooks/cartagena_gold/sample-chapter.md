The automatic doors of the Rafael Núñez International Airport slide open, and the atmosphere doesn't just greet me; it assaults me.

It is a physical violation. The heat is a wet, heavy hand clamping over my mouth, pressing against my chest, sliding uninvited under the collar of my coat. It smells of jet fuel, salt brine, and the thick, sweet rot of the swamp that surrounds the tarmac.

I stop dead in the threshold, my wheeled carry-on jerking to a halt against my heel.

*Mistake.*

The word flashes in my mind, bright and warning-red like a dashboard light. I am wearing a cashmere wool coat, a structured blazer beneath that, and a silk blouse buttoned to the throat. Five hours ago, in Toronto, it was minus ten degrees. The air was sterilized, scrubbed clean by filtration systems, polite and invisible. Here, the air is a living thing. It wants to fuck you, or fight you, or possibly both.

I drag my suitcase toward the nearest restroom, sweat already prickling along my hairline, an itchy, claustrophobic heat that makes me want to claw my own skin off.

The bathroom is tiled in aggressive turquoise and smells of bleach fighting a losing war against urine and humidity. I lock the stall door. It’s flimsy, rattling in its frame. My movements are frantic, almost violent, as I strip. Coat off. Blazer off. I shove them into my open suitcase, crushing the expensive wool without mercy. I hate them suddenly. I hate the armor that makes me a queen in Canada and a suffocating joke in Colombia.

I catch my reflection in the spotty mirror over the sink.

My face is pale, the winter-pale of a woman who lives in professional kitchens and high-rise condos. My dark hair is pulled back in a bun so severe it pulls at my temples, but the humidity is already working its chaotic magic, frizzing the edges. I splash cold water on my wrists. It turns tepid before it dries.

"Get in. Sell the heap. Get out," I whisper to the mirror. My voice sounds thin, swallowed by the damp acoustics.

I am Isabela Restrepo. I run two of the most disciplined kitchens in Toronto. I do not sweat. I do not unravel. I certainly do not let a city that rejected me twenty-five years ago see me falter.

I apply a layer of red lipstick—my war paint—and march out to the taxi rank. The noise hits me next. It’s a wall of sound: shouting taxi drivers, the rhythmic thud of *vallenato* blasting from a passing bus, the aggressive honking that serves as a language all its own.

"Ciudad Amurallada," I tell the driver, sliding into the backseat of a yellow zapatico.

The air conditioning is broken, naturally. We tear through the traffic, weaving between luxury SUVs and donkey carts. I watch the city blur past—the chaotic sprawl of the outer neighborhoods, the vibrant, desperate energy of it all. I feel nothing but a distant, clinical judgment. It’s messy. It’s loud. It’s inefficient.

Then we pass the walls.

The massive stone fortifications rise up, dark and brooding against the twilight. We slip through the Boca del Puente, and the world shifts. The noise dampens, absorbed by centuries of coral stone. The streets narrow. Balconies overflow with bougainvillea, spilling purple and violent pink over the streets.

It is beautiful. And I hate that it is beautiful. I hate that my chest tightens, a traitorous ache that feels like nostalgia but is actually just the pressure of ghosts.

The taxi stops in front of a heavy wooden door studded with iron clavos. The sign above it is faded, the gold leaf peeling away to reveal the gray wood beneath: *Casa de los Santos*.

"Here, señora," the driver says.

I pay him and step out. The heat here in the walled city is different—still oppressive, but trapped, still, breathless. I push the small pedestrian door open within the massive gate and step into the courtyard.

#### * * *

Silence.

The street noise vanishes, replaced by the sound of dripping water and the rustle of leaves. The courtyard is a jungle. Ferns the size of small cars fight for space with overgrown palms. The central fountain is dry, filled with dead leaves, but the air is thick with the scent of jasmine and something earthier. Wet stone. Soil.

And him.

I don't see him at first. I hear the *thwack* of metal biting into wood.

I look up.

A man is balanced on a ladder halfway up the second-story balcony. He has his back to me. He is shirtless, and for a moment, my brain simply stops processing data and focuses entirely on the topography of his back.

It is a landscape of dark, mahogany skin, slick with sweat that catches the fading light like oil. The muscles shift and coil as he swings a machete at a thick vine choking the railing. *Thwack.* The impact ripples through his shoulders, down the tapered V of his spine, into the waistband of low-slung, paint-stained cargo pants.

He is not a man; he is a sudden, violent biological event.

I stand there, gripping the handle of my Louis Vuitton bag, feeling a flush crawl up my neck that has nothing to do with the temperature. It’s a hot, sharp spike of awareness, primal and humiliating. I haven't had sex in three years—a deliberate, calculated celibacy because sex is messy and men are distracting—and my body decides *now*, in this crumbling money pit, to wake up?

"Excuse me," I say. My voice is sharp, intended to cut.

He pauses mid-swing. He doesn't startle. He slowly lowers the machete, hooking it onto his belt, and turns on the ladder to look down at me.

If his back was a landscape, his face is a ruin—handsome in a way that suggests he knows exactly what he looks like and doesn't care. Heavy brows, a nose that might have been broken once, and a mouth that is currently curving into a slow, lazy smirk. He wipes sweat from his forehead with the back of his wrist.

"You must be Doña Isabela," he says.

His voice is deep, a baritone rumble that seems to vibrate through the humid air and settle in the soles of my feet. He speaks Spanish with the coastal cadence—fast, eating the ends of the words, rhythmic.

"I am," I reply, straightening my spine. "And you are the caretaker. Vargas?"

"Cuesta," he corrects, unbothered. "Diego Cuesta. Vargas left two years ago. The termites ate his patience."

He doesn't come down. He stays up there, looming, looking down at me like I’m the intruder and he’s the king of this rotting castle. His eyes drop to my shoes—Italian leather heels, completely impractical for cobblestones—then travel up my legs, over my hips, pausing at the silk blouse that is currently sticking to my bra, before meeting my eyes.

It’s an appraisal. It’s insolent. It makes my nipples harden against the damp silk, and I want to fire him immediately just to stop the sensation.

"You're early," he says. "The apartment isn't ready. The AC is dead."

"I didn't come for the air conditioning," I snap. "And I didn't expect a welcome committee. Just the keys."

He laughs, a low, rich sound. "In Cartagena, *patrona*, everything is a committee. And keys don't work if the locks are rusted shut."

He descends the ladder then. He moves with a fluid, predatory grace that shouldn't belong to a man of his size. When his boots hit the stone floor, the courtyard feels suddenly smaller. He walks toward me, and the smell of him hits me—not cologne, but the scent of labor. Sawdust, rain, musk, and the sharp tang of male sweat.

It is intoxicating. It smells like *work*. It smells like everything my sanitized life in Toronto has scrubbed away.

He stops too close. He wipes his hand on his pants—a deliberate, casual gesture—before extending it.

"Welcome home, Isa."

He uses the diminutive. Not *Doña Isabela*. Just Isa. It sounds intimate, like a secret whispered in the dark.

I hesitate, then take his hand. His palm is rough, calloused and hard against my manicured skin. His grip is firm, warm, swallowing my hand. A jolt of electricity, stupid and cliché and undeniable, shoots up my arm.

"I'm here to sell the hotel, Mr. Cuesta," I say, pulling my hand back a fraction of a second too quickly. "I'm not here to reminisce. I need to see the state of the property. Now."

He crosses his arms over that distractingly broad chest. A bead of sweat tracks from his collarbone, navigating the pectoral muscle, disappearing into the dark hair leading down to his navel. I watch it. I can’t help it. My mouth waters, a physiological betrayal that makes me furious.

*Focus, Isabela. He is an employee. He is an expense.*

"You want a tour now?" He gestures to the darkening sky. "There's no power in the East Wing. It's full of bats."

"I have a flashlight on my phone," I say, lifting my chin. "Lead the way."

#### * * *

The hotel is a disaster.

It is worse than the reports said. It is a tragedy of neglect. We walk through the ground floor, my heels clicking sharply on the tiles, a staccato rhythm against the heavy thud of his boots.

"Water damage," I say, pointing to a bloom of brown mold on the ceiling of what used to be the dining room.

"Roof leak from the last rainy season," Diego says. He doesn't sound apologetic. He sounds like a doctor describing a chronic illness. "I patched it, but the beams are soft."

"And the floor?" I gesture to the warped wood near the window.

"Termites. They like the mahogany. They have expensive taste."

I run a finger along a side table. It comes away gray with dust. "It's filthy."

"It's dust, Isa. The building breathes. The stone sheds. You can clean it in the morning, and by sunset, it's back. It's how the city reminds you that you don't really own anything."

I look at him sharply. "I own this building."

He leans against the doorframe, that infuriating half-smile playing on his lips. "You hold the deed. The city holds the building."

We move upstairs. The heat rises with us, accumulating in the stairwell. The air is thick enough to chew. My silk blouse is soaked through now, clinging to my back like a second skin. I feel gross, sticky, and irritable. He, conversely, seems to thrive in it. He glows.

He opens the door to the master suite—my grandmother’s old room.

The shutters are closed, sealing in the heat of the day. He walks over and throws them open. The sounds of the street rush in—a distant siren, laughter, the rhythmic scraping of a vendor’s cart.

"This room is sound," he says. "I checked the floorboards myself."

I walk to the center of the room. The four-poster bed is draped in mosquito netting that looks gray with age. The furniture is heavy, dark, oppressive. It smells of lavender sachets that lost their scent a decade ago, and underneath that, the sweet, cloying smell of dry rot.

"It's a wreck," I say, more to myself than him. "I'll have to gut it. The buyers will want a blank slate."

Diego stiffens. It’s subtle, a tension in his shoulders. "The buyers? Holguín?"

"He's made an offer. A generous one."

"Holguín puts up drywall and plastic," Diego says, his voice dropping an octave. "He turns history into a theme park for gringos who want to drink mojitos without smelling the city."

"It's not your concern what he does with it."

"I've kept this place standing for fifteen years," he says, stepping closer. The amusement is gone from his face now. He looks dangerous. "I've held the roof up with my own hands. I've fought the water, the bugs, and the bank. It is my concern."

"You were paid to do a job."

"I was paid to protect it. Not to dress it up for a funeral."

We are standing in the dark room, illuminated only by the streetlights filtering through the balcony doors. The air between us is charged, volatile. It’s anger, yes. But it’s wrapped around something else.

I am acutely aware of how alone we are. I am aware of the size of him, the heat radiating off his body. I am aware that I am a woman who has spent her life controlling every variable—temperature, ingredients, portion sizes, emotions—and right now, I am controlling nothing.

My gaze drops to his hands. They are large, scarred, dusted with the residue of the vines he was cutting. I imagine, with a sudden, vivid clarity that nearly knocks the wind out of me, what those hands would feel like on my waist. Not gentle. I don't want gentle. I want the way he gripped that machete. I want him to look at me with that same focus—like I am a problem he needs to hack through to get to the core.

I swallow, my throat dry.

"I'm tired, Diego," I say, my voice steady only by sheer force of will. "We'll discuss the sale tomorrow. Where am I sleeping?"

He holds my gaze for a beat too long. He knows. I can see it in his eyes—he knows I'm rattled. He knows I'm reacting to him. And he likes it.

"The small suite at the end of the hall," he says softly. "I put clean sheets on. And a fan. It helps with the mosquitoes."

He turns to leave, but pauses at the door.

"Don't fight the heat, Isa," he says, not looking back. "You'll only exhaust yourself. You have to let it in."

He walks out, his boots heavy on the wood.

I stand there in the center of the rotting room, trembling. I wrap my arms around myself, feeling the damp silk, the sweat trickling down between my breasts.

I am supposed to be the ice queen. I am the woman who left. I am the one who succeeded.

But as the sound of his footsteps fades down the corridor, I realize with a sinking, terrifying certainty that my armor didn't make it past customs. I am here, exposed, in a city that wants to consume me, with a man who looks like he's already started.

I walk to the balcony and look down into the courtyard. The ladder is still there, leaning against the wall. A testament to unfinished work.

I press my hand against the rough stone of the parapet. It’s still warm from the sun. It pulses against my palm, like a heartbeat.

"Damn it," I whisper.

I turn and head for the room with the fan, knowing I won't sleep. The heat is already inside.
