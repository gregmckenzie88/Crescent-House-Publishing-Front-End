The office of Mr. Abernathy smells like old paper and the kind of aggressive lemon polish used to mask the scent of dying things. It’s a smell I associate with funeral parlors and the church vestry, places where silence is mandatory and judgment is swift.

I sit with my knees pressed together, ankles crossed, hands folded in my lap. The posture is muscle memory. My spine doesn’t touch the back of the leather chair. Good girls don’t slouch. Good girls don’t take up space. Good girls wait to be told what they’ve been given.

Mr. Abernathy clears his throat, a wet, rattling sound that makes me want to wince, but I keep my face smooth. My expression is a porcelain mask I’ve been perfecting since I was five years old. *Serene. Grateful. Pious.*

"Riley," he says, looking over his spectacles. He doesn't call me Faith. That’s the first crack in the world I know. My father calls me Faith. The congregation calls me Faith. Only sinners and dead people call me Riley. "Your grandmother’s will is... specific."

"I understand," I say softly. My voice is a flute in a lower register, breathy and harmless. "She was a specific woman."

That’s a polite way of saying Loretta Vance was a firecracker who drank whiskey with her morning coffee and wore red lipstick to Sunday service just to watch the deacons sweat. I haven't seen her in six years. My father, Pastor Josiah Sullivan, made sure of that. *Bad influences,* he’d said, closing the door on her like he was sealing a tomb.

"She has left you the house on Elm," Abernathy says, sliding a document across the mahogany desk. "And the contents of her savings account. It’s substantial, Riley. Enough to keep you comfortable for a long time."

I nod. Money is useful, but it’s not freedom. Not really. Money just means better cages.

"And," Abernathy pauses. He takes off his glasses and rubs the bridge of his nose, looking tired. He looks at me with something that feels uncomfortably like pity. Or maybe it’s warning. "She has left you the commercial property on the Flats. The business known as *The Black Sheep*."

The air in the room seems to vanish.

*The Black Sheep.* The bar. The dive bar on the wrong side of the tracks where the miners and the roughnecks go to drink away their paychecks. The place my father calls the Antechamber of Hell.

"The bar?" The words slip out before I can polish them.

"The building, the liquor license, the stock. Everything." Abernathy leans forward. "Your father has already called, Riley. He’s... distressed. He assumes you will be selling immediately. He has a buyer lined up. The church wants to bulldoze it for a parking lot."

Of course he does. He wants to pave over Loretta’s legacy with asphalt and paint white lines on it so the righteous have a place to park their sedans.

I look at the deed sitting on the desk. It’s heavy, creamy paper. It looks official. It looks like a weapon.

"Did she leave a letter?" I ask.

Abernathy hands me a small, sealed envelope. It smells like her perfume—gardenias and stale smoke. My heart kicks against my ribs, a trapped bird desperate to fly.

I don't open it. I just slide it into my purse.

"Riley," Abernathy says, his voice dropping. "You can sign the power of attorney over to your father right now. We can make this go away. You don't have to deal with... that element."

*That element.* The sinners. The drinkers. The people who don't spend their Sunday mornings being told how unworthy they are.

I think of my father’s face at breakfast this morning. The way he looked at my toast and told me I was indulging in gluttony. The way he checks the odometer on my car. The way he picked out the beige cardigan I’m wearing right now because the red one was "too loud."

I am twenty-five years old, and I have never made a decision that mattered. I am a glass child—transparent, fragile, existing only to reflect his light.

I reach out and put my hand on the deed. The paper is cool under my fingertips.

"I’ll need the keys," I say.

Abernathy blinks. "I beg your pardon?"

"The keys, Mr. Abernathy. To my property."

My voice doesn't shake. It surprises us both.

#### * * *

The drive to the Flats feels like a defection.

Grace Falls is a bowl of a town, trapped by mountains that scrape the sky. The church and the nice houses are up on the Rim, where the air is thin and expensive. The Flats are down in the valley shadow, where the heat settles and the dust never quite leaves.

I drive my sensible sedan past the abandoned textile mill, past the rows of shotgun houses with peeling paint, until the road turns to gravel.

And there it is.

*The Black Sheep* is ugly. It’s a squat, brick building with barred windows and a neon sign that’s been dark for years. It looks like a bruise on the landscape.

I park the car and just sit there for a moment. My phone is buzzing in my purse. *Father.* *Father.* *Father.* The vibrations against my hip feel like an accusation. I turn the phone off. The silence that follows is heavy, thick with the heat of the afternoon.

I step out. The heat down here is different—wetter, heavier. It smells of ozone and diesel. I smooth my skirt, a nervous tic I can’t break, and walk to the heavy oak door.

The key is brass and heavy. It fights me in the lock, rusted and stubborn, but with a sharp *crack*, the tumbler gives. I push the door open and step inside.

Darkness.

It takes a moment for my eyes to adjust. When they do, I’m standing in a cavern of shadows. The air inside is stale, preserved like a tomb. It smells of old beer, sawdust, and the ghost of cigarette smoke that has seeped into the wood grain over decades.

It should be repulsive. It should smell like sin.

Instead, it smells like... reality.

I walk further in, my heels clicking loudly on the hardwood floor. Shafts of sunlight slice through the dust-caked high windows, illuminating swirling motes that dance like tiny angels.

I run my hand along the bar. It’s mahogany, scarred by years of elbows and glasses and cigarettes. It feels solid. Real. I imagine Loretta standing back there, pouring shots, laughing with her head thrown back, owning her space. She wasn't a glass child. She was granite.

I walk behind the bar. There are glasses still in the rack, coated in gray dust. I pick one up, wiping the grime away with my thumb.

"Mine," I whisper. The word sounds foreign.

I spin in a slow circle. The space is massive. A stage in the corner where bands used to play. Booths lined with cracked red vinyl. A jukebox silent in the corner.

I could sell it. I could let Dad turn it into a parking lot. I could go back to teaching choir and wearing beige and marrying the Youth Pastor he’s been inviting to dinner for three months.

Or.

I could burn my life down.

The thought sends a shiver through me that has nothing to do with the temperature. It’s a thrill, dark and electric, sparking in my belly. I trace the edge of the bar, my nail digging into the wood.

*Thump.*

The sound comes from above. A heavy, rhythmic thud.

I freeze. My heart hammers against my sternum. I’m alone in a bar on the bad side of town. This is how the horror movies start. This is what my father warned me about. *Wolves, Faith. The world is full of wolves.*

*Thump. Scrape.*

It’s coming from the roof.

I should leave. I should run to my car and lock the doors. But the curiosity that has always been my secret vice—the same curiosity that makes me read romance novels with the covers torn off—pulls my feet toward the back door.

I push through the "Employees Only" swing door into a small alley behind the building.

The sun is blinding out here. I shield my eyes, looking up.

There is a ladder propped against the brick. And coming down it is a pair of boots.

Heavy, worn work boots. Then denim, faded and dusted with white powder. Then a tool belt, heavy with hammers and drills, hanging low on narrow hips.

And then, skin.

Acres of it.

The man is shirtless. His back is to me as he descends, and the muscles shift under his skin like tectonic plates. He is broad—impossibly broad—with shoulders that look like they were carved out of the mountain itself. Sweat gleams on his spine, tracing a path down to the waistband of his jeans.

He is covered in ink. Dark, intricate tattoos wrap around his arms, climbing over his shoulders, disappearing onto his chest. They aren't the neat, trendy tattoos the college kids in Missoula get. These look like battle armor.

He hits the ground with a heavy thud, dust puffing around his boots.

He turns around.

The air leaves my lungs in a sharp *whoosh*.

He is terrifying. That’s my first thought. He has a face that looks like it’s been in fights and won them all, but at a cost. A square jaw covered in graying stubble, a nose that’s been broken at least once, and eyes that are dark, intelligent, and completely unamused.

He wipes his forehead with the back of a gloved hand, smearing dirt across his temple. Then he sees me.

He doesn't smile. He doesn't do the polite head nod that men in town do when they see the pastor’s daughter. He just stares. His gaze starts at my sensible shoes, travels up my beige skirt, lingers on the high collar of my blouse, and lands on my face.

It feels physical. It feels like he just ran a rough hand over my entire body.

"You're early," he says. His voice is a low rumble, like gravel tumbling in a mixer. It vibrates in the soles of my feet.

I blink, trying to find my voice. "I... excuse me?"

"The lawyer said the Sullivan girl wouldn't be here 'til tomorrow." He pulls off his leather gloves, shoving them into his back pocket. His hands are large, the knuckles scarred, dust caught in the dark hair on his forearms.

"I'm Riley," I say. Not Faith. "And this is my property. Who are you?"

He snorts, a short, derisive sound. He walks past me, too close. I can smell him—sawdust, hot tar, and the sharp, salty tang of male sweat. It’s overwhelming. It’s the smell of hard labor and no apologies. My mouth floods with saliva.

"Cade Mercer," he says, grabbing a water cooler from the back of a battered Ford truck I hadn't noticed parked near the dumpster. "Your grandma hired me to fix the roof before she passed. I finish what I start."

Cade Mercer.

The name hits me like a slap. I know that name. Everyone in Grace Falls knows that name. The Pariah. The man who went to prison. The man mothers use to frighten their daughters into curfew. *Don't go near the Flats, or Cade Mercer will get you.*

He unscrews the lid of the cooler and takes a long drink, water spilling down his chin and tracking through the dust on his chest. I watch a droplet roll over a scar on his pectoral muscle and disappear into the dark hair trailing down his stomach.

I can't look away. I am the Lot’s Wife of lust, frozen in a pillar of salt, staring at the destruction.

He lowers the jug and catches me staring. He doesn't look away. He doesn't look embarrassed. His eyes narrow slightly, darker than coal.

"See something you like, Princess?"

The nickname is an insult. He says it with a sneer, mocking my clean clothes, my soft hands, my father’s reputation.

Heat flares up my neck, hot and stinging. "I'm inspecting the premises," I say, my voice trembling just a little. "I didn't know there were... workmen."

"Contractor," he corrects, stepping into my personal space again. He towers over me. I have to tilt my head back to look him in the eye. He smells dangerous. He smells like everything forbidden. "And I'm not cheap. So unless you plan on selling this place to the church so they can turn it into a shrine to your daddy's ego, you better check the accounts."

He knows. He knows everything.

"I haven't decided what I'm doing," I lie.

He laughs, and it’s a dry, humorless sound. "Sure you haven't. Run home, Sullivan. This place has rot in the beams. You aren't built for it."

He turns his back on me, dismissing me like I’m a child who wandered into a construction zone. He grabs the ladder with one hand—one hand—and adjusts it, the muscles in his bicep jumping like coiled snakes.

"I'm keeping it," I say to his back.

He pauses. He looks over his shoulder, and for a second, the sneer is gone, replaced by something sharper. Something that looks like assessment.

"We'll see," he says.

Then he starts climbing, leaving me standing in the dust, my heart hammering a frantic, wet rhythm against my ribs.

#### * * *

I make it two miles down the road before I have to pull over.

My hands are shaking so hard I can’t grip the steering wheel. I guide the car onto the shoulder, under the shade of a dying cottonwood tree, and kill the engine.

Silence rushes back in, but it’s not peaceful. My blood is roaring in my ears.

*Run home, Sullivan. You aren't built for it.*

I close my eyes, and instantly, he’s there.

The image is burned onto the back of my eyelids. The way the sun hit the sweat on his shoulders. The thick cords of his neck. The dirt smeared on his temple. But mostly, it’s his hands.

Those hands.

Rough. Calloused. Stained with work. Hands that build things and break things. Hands that don't ask for permission.

A sound escapes my throat, a whimper that would shame my father. I slide down in the seat, my knees falling open.

The fantasy hits me without my consent. It rolls over me like a dark wave.

I’m not in the car. I’m back in the bar. But I’m not standing. I’m sitting on the unfinished bar top, the wood rough against my thighs.

And I am not flesh and bone. I am wood. I am a piece of raw, unshaped timber.

Cade is there. He’s not looking at me with disdain. He’s looking at me with the focused, intense glare of a craftsman.

*This place has rot in the beams,* he said.

In my mind, he steps between my knees. He doesn't speak. He doesn't need to. He runs those broad, sandpaper palms up my calves, over my knees, dragging against the silk of my skin like he’s testing the grain.

I shudder, my hips bucking slightly against the leather seat of the car.

He picks up a power sander. I can hear the whine of the motor, feel the vibration in the air.

He presses it against me.

Not to hurt. To smooth. To strip away the varnish. To take off the layers of paint my father put there—the beige, the modesty, the fear.

He runs the machine up my inner thigh. The vibration is intense, teeth-rattling. It hums against my skin, buzzing through my nerves. I gasp, head falling back against the headrest.

In the fantasy, I can’t move. I am the project. I have no choice. I have to let him work on me. I have to let him fix me.

He presses his weight against me, pinning me to the bar. He smells of sawdust and musk. He leans in, his mouth right at my ear, the stubble of his jaw scraping the sensitive skin of my neck.

*Hold still,* he growls. *I'm not done with you.*

His hand, the one not holding the tool, grips my hip. His thumb digs in, finding the soft spot, pressing until it bruises. The vibration moves higher, closer to the center of me, closer to the heat that’s pooling in my belly.

I am wet. So wet I can feel it soaking my underwear.

*Strip it down,* I think, the words a frantic prayer in my head. *Strip it all away.*

The imaginary machine hits the center of me, and my hips snap up. A jolt of electricity arcs through my spine. I bite my lip so hard I taste copper.

I’m panting, the car windows fogging slightly with my breath. My hand drifts down, skating over the fabric of my skirt, desperate to touch, desperate to replicate the pressure I’m imagining.

But I stop.

I stop because I see my hand. Pale. Manicured. A ring on my right hand with a cross on it.

The shame crashes down instantly, an anvil dropped from the sky.

I snatch my hand back as if I’ve been burned. I sit up straight, shoving my skirt down, smoothing the fabric with trembling fingers.

* disgusting.*
*Whore.*
*What would he think if he knew?*

My father’s voice. God’s voice. They sound the same in my head.

I stare out the windshield at the empty road. The mountains loom ahead, gray and judgmental.

I am Riley Faith Sullivan. I teach music to third graders. I play the organ on Sundays. I am a vessel of light.

But down between my legs, I am throbbing. And the smell of sawdust is stuck in my nose, sweeter than any incense.

I grip the steering wheel until my knuckles turn white. I check my face in the rearview mirror. My cheeks are flushed, my eyes bright and wild. I look like a stranger.

I look like Loretta.

I start the car. I have to go home. I have to wash my face and put on the beige cardigan and eat dinner with my father and listen to him talk about the decline of moral values in America.

But as I pull back onto the road, the brass key in my purse feels heavy. It feels hot.

I’m not selling the bar.

Let the rot take me.
