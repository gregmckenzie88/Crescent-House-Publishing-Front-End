The Sleigh Hangar at 0300 hours is the only place in the North Pole complex where I can hear myself think.

There are no chiming bells here. No relentless, joyful carols piped in through hidden speakers. No pastel-clad Omegas giggling in the breakroom about which Alpha smiled at them during the cocoa ration. Down here in Sector 7, the air is sub-zero and smells like burning ozone and hydraulic grease. It smells like work.

I slide my back along the cold titanium underbelly of the Sleigh, shimmying into the crawlspace between the port runner and the main propulsion matrix. It’s a tight squeeze. My coveralls, thick insulated canvas, scrape against the metal with a sound like a zipper being dragged over teeth.

*Tight* is an understatement. I have to exhale fully to fit my hips through the access hatch. If I were a standard Alpha mechanic, I wouldn’t fit at all. They’re too broad, too bulky with muscle that’s good for lifting crates but useless for finesse. This is why I’m the lead engineer, even if the payroll still lists me as "Junior Associate." I fit where the problems are.

"Alright, big girl," I whisper, reaching up to tap the manifold above my face. "Talk to me. Show me where it hurts."

I don't talk to people like this. People are messy variables. The Sleigh—the Mark IV Evergreen Displacement Unit—is pure logic wrapped in magic.

I pull the diagnostic tablet from my chest pocket, the screen glowing a harsh, clinical blue in the darkness. My fingers are stained with molybdenum grease, black crescents under my nails that no amount of scrubbing will ever fully remove. The other Omegas in the dorms look at my hands like I have a contagious skin disease. Let them look. Their hands are soft. Mine keep Christmas airborne.

"Propulsion matrix upgrade, iteration forty-two," I dictate quietly. My breath puffs out in a white cloud, vanishing into the machinery. "Calibrating the spirit-intake valves."

I reach blindly into the nest of wires and conduits above me. My fingers find the vibration damper—a heavy ring of enchanted ironwood—and twist. It gives a quarter turn.

*Click.*

The sensation of rightness snaps through me, better than a shot of espresso. The alignment is perfect. I can feel the potential energy waiting in the lines, the Resonance dormant but ready.

My shoulder cramps, a sharp pinch near the scapula, but I ignore it. I’ve been awake for nineteen hours. The promotion list is posted tomorrow morning. Three years in a row, I’ve been the most qualified candidate for Director of R&D. Three years in a row, the Council has given the title to an Alpha who can barely spell "aerodynamics" but looks good in a press photo.

*Not this time,* I tell myself, the thought sharp and bitter as a lemon rind. *They can’t ignore a forty percent efficiency increase. I won’t let them.*

I twist my body, leverage precarious in the cramped space, and connect the bypass lead. A spark jumps—blue and hot—stinging my wrist. I don't flinch. Pain is just sensory input; it means the circuit is live.

"You’re running hot," I murmur, checking the tablet. The numbers are scrolling fast, a waterfall of data. "Don't be temperamental. I designed you better than that."

I feel the vibration start deep in the floor, transmitting through the chassis and into my spine. The hum of the standby generators. It’s a low C, resonating in the hollow of my chest. Most people think the Sleigh runs on joy. They’re idiots. It runs on belief, refined into a volatile, high-yield plasma. It’s dangerous, unstable, and beautiful.

And right now, it’s all mine.

I finish the final calibration on the port drive and let my head rest back against the cold metal for a second. Just one second. The exhaustion is a heavy blanket, trying to smother me. My eyes burn. Somewhere in the back of my mind, a biological clock is ticking, louder than the engine. My cycle is approaching. I can feel the pre-symptoms—the heightened sense of smell, the irritability, the way my skin feels too tight for my body.

*Ignore it.* Biology is a flaw in the system. I can engineer around it.

I wiggle backward, dragging myself out of the machine's gut. My boots hit the grate floor of the hangar with a solid thud. I stand up, stretching my spine until it pops, and wipe a streak of sweat from my forehead, undoubtedly smearing more grease across my skin.

The Hangar is a cathedral of industry. Steel girders vanish into the shadows hundreds of feet above, and the Sleigh sits on the central dais like a sleeping predator, all sleek runners and gold-leaf trim hiding the terrifying power beneath.

I walk to the main console, a bank of monitors and levers on a raised platform overlooking the dock. It’s time.

"System test initiated," I say to the empty room. My voice echoes, lonely and small against the vastness.

I punch in the sequence.

The Sleigh wakes up.

It starts as a purr, a thrumming vibration that rattles the tools on the workbench. Lights flicker on along the hull—amber, then green. The Spirit-injectors hiss as they prime.

"Come on," I whisper, gripping the edge of the console until my knuckles turn white. "Show me the numbers."

The thrust output graph climbs. 80%. 90%. It’s climbing faster than the simulations predicted. My heart hammers against my ribs, syncing with the turbine whine. This is it. This is the breakthrough.

95%.

The air in the hangar begins to taste like peppermint and ozone—the smell of raw magic ionizing the atmosphere.

98%.

"Steady," I command.

The readout hits 100%. Optimal efficiency. It’s holding. It’s actually holding. A grin splits my face, fierce and victorious. I did it. I actually did it.

Then the sound changes.

It’s not the smooth whine of the turbine anymore. It’s a scream—metal shearing against metal. A dissonance that tears through my eardrums.

On the screen, the pressure gauge for the main drive shaft spikes red.

*Impossible.*

"Abort," I shout, slamming the emergency kill switch. "Cut fuel! Vent the lines!"

The system doesn't respond. The kill switch is dead.

I watch, helpless, paralyzed by the horror of physics taking over, as the main drive shaft glows blinding white.

The explosion doesn't sound like a bang. It sounds like the world cracking in half.

#### * * *

The shockwave hits me before the sound does.

It lifts me off the platform and throws me backward. I don't have time to be afraid. I just have time to register the ceiling spinning, the flash of red emergency lights, and then the brutal impact of the bulkhead meeting my back.

I slide down the wall, gasping for air that isn't there. My lungs are seized.

*Breathe. Diagnose. Reboot.*

I force a ragged breath into my chest. It tastes like copper and smoke.

The hangar is screaming. Alarms are blaring—a rhythmic, deafening *whoop-whoop-whoop* that drills into my skull. Thick black smoke is billowing from the Sleigh’s undercarriage, obscuring the precious machine I just spent six months perfecting.

"No," I croak. I scramble to my feet, stumbling. My left knee gives way, and I catch myself on a railing. "No, no, no."

I limp toward the edge of the platform. The fire suppression system kicks in, dousing the Sleigh in chemical foam. The white clouds hiss as they hit the superheated metal.

My eyes scan the wreckage, bypassing the panic to find the data. The casing on the drive shaft is peeled back like a banana skin. That shouldn't happen. That alloy is rated for temperatures three times what the engine produces.

I vault over the railing, ignoring the throbbing pain in my knee, and slide down the ladder to the hangar floor. The heat down here is intense, radiating from the wounded machine.

"Computer!" I yell over the alarms. "Damage report!"

"Critical failure in Sector Seven," the automated voice replies, calm and infuriating. "Propulsion drive compromised. Structural integrity at sixty percent."

I reach the Sleigh and drop to my knees beside the shattered remains of the drive shaft. The foam is cold and slimy, soaking through my coveralls instantly. I don't care. I reach into the mess, burning my fingertips on a piece of shrapnel.

I pull it out. A jagged shard of the containment ring.

I stare at it, my brain trying to reconcile what I’m seeing with what I know about metallurgy. The break isn't clean. It’s not a stress fracture. The metal looks... corroded. Eaten away.

I bring the shard closer to my face, squinting through the smoke. There’s a residue on the edge. It’s not soot. It’s a faint, purple slime that seems to absorb the light around it.

My stomach drops, a sensation of vertigo more violent than the explosion.

This wasn't a malfunction. I checked those calibrations three times. I crawled inside that engine and felt its heartbeat.

I wipe a finger through the purple residue. It tingles, a cold, numbing sensation that crawls up my nerve endings like a spider.

*Anti-magic.*

This is sabotage.

The realization hits me with the force of a physical blow. Someone did this. Someone fed a corruption hex into the intake.

"Step away from the vehicle!"

The voice booms from the upper gantry, amplified and aggressive.

I look up, shielding my eyes against the flashing strobes. Security drones are descending from the ceiling, their red laser sights sweeping the floor. Behind them, a squad of Elf Enforcers is rappelling down, weapons drawn.

I clutch the shard of metal in my hand, squeezing it until the sharp edge cuts my palm. The pain grounds me.

I am not the victim here. I am the witness. And I am the only one smart enough to fix this.

"I said step away!" the lead officer shouts, landing heavily a few yards from me. He’s an Alpha, of course. Big, loud, and pointing a stun-baton at my chest.

I stand up slowly, raising my grease-stained hands. I don't drop the shard.

"It wasn't an error," I say, my voice steady despite the trembling in my legs. "It was an attack."

The officer sneers, looking me up and down. I know what he sees. A messy, manic Omega female covered in grime, standing over a billion-dollar disaster.

"Save it for the Council, Pine," he spits. "You're coming with us."

#### * * *

The Council Chamber is designed to make you feel small.

The ceilings are impossibly high, painted with frescoes of Christmas Past—stern, bearded men delivering judgment and toys. The table is a massive slab of polished mahogany, long enough to land a reindeer on. And the light... the light is unforgiving.

I stand at the foot of the table. I refused to let them clean me up. I’m wearing the explosion like war paint. Grease on my cheeks, chemical foam drying in my hair, the smell of smoke clinging to me like a second skin.

The five members of the Emergency Council stare down at me. They are immaculate in their velvet robes and gold chains. They smell like expensive cologne and stagnation.

"Lead Engineer Pine," the High Councilor says. His voice is dry, like paper rustling. "This is a grave situation. The loss of the propulsion matrix three weeks before Launch is... catastrophic."

"It would be," I cut in, my voice ringing off the marble walls, "if I hadn't designed the backup redundancy systems last summer. The Sleigh isn't dead. It's crippled."

The Councilor frowns. He doesn't like being interrupted. Especially not by the help. "Your test run destroyed the primary shaft. The logs show you pushed the engine to 110%."

"The logs show efficiency," I snap. "The engine didn't fail. The material did."

I reach into my pocket and slam the jagged shard of metal onto the pristine mahogany table. It makes a satisfying *thwack*, leaving a smear of black grease and purple slime on the wood.

The Council members recoil as if I’ve tossed a live grenade.

"Look at the fracture lines," I demand, pointing a shaking finger. "That’s acid corrosion. Magical entropy. Someone painted the intake valve with a destabilizing agent. When the Resonance hit it, it didn't just break; it unmade itself."

Silence stretches in the room. A heavy, uncomfortable silence.

"Sabotage," a voice says from the shadows in the corner of the room.

I turn. I hadn't noticed anyone standing there. The shadows seem to cling to that corner unnaturaly.

Three men step into the light.

The air in the room instantly changes. It gets heavier, thicker. The scent of ozone and smoke on me is suddenly overwhelmed by something else—something primal. Pine needles. Musk. Cold iron.

My breath hitches. My biological alarm bells, the ones I’ve been suppressing all day, start ringing so loud I can barely hear.

*Alphas.* Not just administrative Alphas like the Council. *Prime* Alphas.

The one who spoke is in the center. He’s terrifying. That’s the only word for it. He’s wearing a black tactical uniform that fits him like a second skin, showing off shoulders that are impossibly broad. His hair is silver-white, cut short and severe, and his face is a map of hard lines and old scars. He looks like a fortress wall given human form.

To his left is a man who looks like he just walked out of a blizzard. Long, pale hair, skin that glows with a faint luminescence, and eyes that are entirely too dark, like looking into a deep well. He moves with a fluid, predatory grace that makes the hair on my arms stand up.

And on the right... chaos. He’s younger, wiry and coiled with energy. He’s bouncing on the balls of his feet, his sleeves rolled up to reveal forearms covered in tattoos of antlers and vines. He’s grinning, but it’s a sharp, dangerous grin.

"Garland Ironwood," the High Councilor says, sounding relieved. "You agree with the girl?"

The silver-haired man—Garland—doesn't look at the Councilor. He looks at me. His eyes are the color of slate, cold and impenetrable. He scans me from my messy hair to my grease-stained boots. It’s not a sexual look. It’s a tactical assessment. He’s looking for weak points.

"I agree that metal doesn't dissolve on its own," Garland says. His voice is a low rumble that I feel in the soles of my feet. "And I agree that Engineer Pine looks like she’s ready to bite the throat out of anyone who says otherwise."

The younger one snorts. "She’s got a point, Boss. Smell that? That’s entropy residue. Nasty stuff." He sniffs the air, his nostrils flaring. Then his gaze locks on me, and his pupils dilate. "And she smells like... stress. Lots of stress."

I stiffen, crossing my arms over my chest. "My olfactory output is none of your business."

The ethereal one, the one on the left, takes a step forward. "Mistletoe Northstar," he says softly. His voice is melodic, hypnotic. "Chief Navigator. And this is Bells Tinselsmith, Handler." He gestures to the energetic one.

Garland steps up to the table, picking up the shard I threw down. He doesn't flinch at the slime. He rubs it between his thumb and forefinger.

"Jack," he says. One word.

The Council members gasp.

"Jack Frost has been exiled for centuries," the High Councilor stammers.

"Exile doesn't mean dead," Garland says flatly. He drops the shard. "He’s testing our defenses. And he found a way in."

He turns his slate eyes back to me. "You’re the only one who knows the new engine specs?"

"Yes," I say, lifting my chin. "I wrote the code. I built the matrix."

"Then you’re a target."

"I can take care of myself," I lie. I’m five-foot-four and my only weapon is a soldering iron.

"Negative," Garland says. "If Frost is involved, you are barely a speed bump."

He turns to the Council. "We’re invoking the Evergreen Protocols. Section 9."

The High Councilor pales. "Section 9? That’s... extreme. That authorizes full tactical integration."

"The Sleigh is grounded," Garland says, his voice hard as granite. "We have seventy-two hours until Christmas Eve. If that engine isn't fixed, the belief grid collapses. The Engineer needs to work uninterrupted. And she needs to stay alive."

He looks at me again. The intensity of his gaze is physically heavy. It feels like a hand gripping the back of my neck.

"Hollyn Pine," he says. It’s the first time he’s used my name. It sounds different in his mouth—weighted, significant. "You are hereby assigned a Security and Support Unit. We are your shadow until the Sleigh flies."

"I work alone," I protest, panic rising in my throat. "I don't need a babysitter. I need parts."

"You need protection," Garland corrects. He steps closer, invading my personal space. The heat radiating off him is staggering. It clashes with the cold air of the room, creating a localized storm front. "And you need resources. Bells can get you anything you need. Mist can navigate the magical flux while you weld. And I..."

He pauses, looking down at me. I have to crane my neck to meet his eyes.

"I will make sure nothing touches you," he says. "Not Frost. Not the Council. Nothing."

My heart is hammering a frantic rhythm against my ribs. *Thump-thump-thump.* It’s too much. The proximity of three Prime Alphas is overwhelming my senses. The scent of them—woodsmoke, snow, pine—is flooding my brain, short-circuiting my logic centers.

I look at the Council. They look relieved to hand off the problem.

I look at the Pack.

Bells gives me a wink that is equal parts playful and hungry. Mist is watching me with a serene, terrifying curiosity, like I’m a star he’s about to chart.

And Garland... Garland is just waiting for me to submit.

I swallow hard, my throat dry. I hate this. I hate needing help. I hate the way my body is reacting to them—a treacherous softening in my belly, a heat that has nothing to do with the temperature.

But I love the Sleigh more.

"Fine," I say, my voice sharp. "But stay out of my way. I run the build. You just... hold the flashlight."

Garland’s mouth twitches. It’s almost a smile, but darker.

"Understood, Engineer," he says. "We’re all yours."

The way he says it sounds less like a promise of service and more like a threat. Or a claim.

I turn back to the table, grabbing the shard of metal. My hand is trembling, and this time, I know it’s not from the explosion.

"Then let's go," I say, marching toward the door. "We have work to do."

I feel them fall into step behind me. Three massive, dangerous shadows.

God help me. I’m going to fix the Sleigh, or I’m going to die trying. And looking at the way Garland Ironwood watches me walk away, I have a feeling the danger isn't just coming from the sabotage.

It’s coming from the support team.
